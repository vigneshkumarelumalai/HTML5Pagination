<p class="text-fo">&#x2018;A website converts because customers want to buy the merchandise presented to them,&#x2019; said Kevin Hillstrom,<sup><a href="#ch06_en1" id="ch06_enx1">1</a></sup> one of the world&#x2019;s foremost experts in merchandising data mining.</p>
<p class="text">So, to optimize your e-commerce website and sell more, show your visitors things they want to buy. How do you know what those are?</p>
<p class="text">The answer lies in a specialist form of research and analysis known as merchandising analytics. It involves looking in detail at the interaction between your customers and the product ranges, including categories and pricing.</p>
<p class="text">There are several different merchandising analytics techniques you can use to find out where within your existing product range you can squeeze more sales. Two methods recommended by Hillstrom stand out:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet"><b>new product analysis</b>: the rate at which new products are introduced, and their productivity (ie contribution of each new product to total sales);</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet"><b>bestseller analysis</b>: the rate of decay of best-selling items.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="text-fo">Specific techniques include:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet">product category analysis;</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">look-to-book analysis;</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">price-point analysis;</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">price testing.</p></li>

<h2 id="ch06_h2_001" class="head-a">New product analysis</h2>
<p class="text-fo">Hillstrom<sup><a href="#ch06_en2" id="ch06_enx2">2</a></sup> advocates that businesses should constantly introduce new products, and cultivate them to bestseller status, in order to grow sales. Merchandising analytics can give you the insights to help you achieve this. Here&#x2019;s how you do it.</p>

<h3 id="ch06_h3_001" class="head-b"><span id="page-105" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 105. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>Introducing new products</h3>
<p class="text-fo">The first step is to analyse what you&#x2019;re doing now. Total up the quantity of new items introduced over the previous three years and the revenue they have generated. If a product was introduced in Year 1 then you will need to capture the revenue it took in its first year and Years 2 and 3.</p>
<p class="text">If a product was introduced in Year 2 or 3, you will need to pro-rata them to calculate their likely sales over this three-year period. For example, if you had first-year sales of &#x00A3;100,000, multiply this by three to get the total sales over a three-year period. It&#x2019;s a little rough and ready but will suffice for your analysis.</p>
<p class="text">You will end up with a table that looks something like <a id="rch06_tab_001" href="#ch06_tab_001">Table 6.1</a>.</p>

<p id="ch06_tabskip_001" class="text-fo">This simple exercise can be quite an eye-opener. For example, in the scenario in <a href="#ch06_tab_001">Table 6.1</a>, we can see that over the last three years:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet">The rate at which new products have been introduced has fallen by &#x000A;25 per cent, from 393 per year to 291 per year.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Sales from new products have plummeted by 41 per cent, from &#x00A3;3.5 million to just over &#x00A3;2 million.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Productivity &#x2013; the total sales that each new product contributes &#x2013; has also gone down by 22 per cent, from around &#x00A3;9,000 to around &#x00A3;7,000.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="text-fo">This fictional example paints a gloomy picture. New products are the lifeblood of many e-commerce websites, and here it&#x2019;s ebbing away. &#x2018;Businesses that develop new merchandise today will experience marketing success tomorrow,&#x2019; according to Hillstrom,<sup><a href="#ch06_en3" id="ch06_enx3">3</a></sup> so the declining sales and productivity from new products could have a detrimental effect on their ability to attract new customers and retain existing ones.</p>

<h3 id="ch06_h3_002" class="head-b"><span id="page-106" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 106. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>How to identify potential new products</h3>
<p class="text-fo">Continuing with the above example, this picture may lead the company to launch more new products. So, what products should they introduce? Simply putting out a bigger range of a number of new products does not guarantee high sales. Not all new products are a success, so revenue from the shiny new items may not make up for all that has been lost.</p>
<p class="text">How can you improve the chances of introducing high-performing new products rather than duds? If you&#x2019;re looking for rich sources of inspiration for successful new product development, try the following:</p>
<ol class="list-number"><li><p class="list-number">Look at your failed on-site search data, where visitors typed in something they were looking for, but it came up with no matches. This is a golden insight into what people really want to buy from you.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number">Rank your products by sales, then look at the bestsellers to identify common themes.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number">Use search data to analyse trends and search terms that correspond to your current categories and products. For example, if you sell mirrors, look at the volume of searches for &#x2018;oval mirrors&#x2019;, &#x2018;round mirrors&#x2019; and so on.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number">Identify categories that are growing in sales and items that are doing better than expected. Develop subcategories to increase your authority in this product category and analyse the performance of new products brought into these subcategories.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number">Survey your customers and what problems your current merchandise solves. Their answers could surprise you, and give you valuable ideas on new products to address those problems.</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="text-fo">At the same time, it&#x2019;s also worth analysing which products to cull to make room for more profitable lines, by:</p>
<ol class="list-number"><li><p class="list-number">identifying those paid search terms on exact match, eg &#x2018;oval mirrors&#x2019;, that convert poorly;</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number">examining products that have high rates of returns and refunds;</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number">ranking your products by sales and then looking at the least popular items at the bottom of the list to identify common themes.</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="text-fo">You can also gain clues from analysing your competitors&#x2019; bestsellers, and those in their clearance section. These relatively simple exercises put you in a position to put together a successful new product development programme.</p>

<p class="text-fo">There is a circularity around bestsellers. They get to the top of the list precisely because they are innately desirable and large numbers of people want to buy them. That&#x2019;s important, because these are the products that bring people to your site and trigger them to put the first product in their basket.</p>
<p class="text">What is a bestseller? Your criteria will depend on your particular business models, but Hillstrom<sup><a href="#ch06_en4" id="ch06_enx4">4</a></sup> suggests making the cut at the top 5 per cent ranked by revenue and volume, and also the top 5 per cent ranked by revenue alone:</p>
<ol class="list-number"><li><p class="list-number"><b>Revenue and volume</b>: These items bring in considerable revenue and also sell in large quantities.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number"><b>Revenue alone</b>: These items have a higher ticket price, so they generate considerable revenue but do not sell in such large quantities.</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="text-fo">You&#x2019;ll often find that these few products make up over half of total sales, so they are critical to the success of the business.</p>
<p class="text">When you&#x2019;ve split out your top sellers, simply count the actual number of bestsellers you&#x2019;ve had in each of the last three years. It may look something like <a id="rch06_tab_002" href="#ch06_tab_002">Table 6.2</a>.</p>

<p id="ch06_tabskip_002" class="text-fo">In the example in <a href="#ch06_tab_002">Table 6.2</a>, there has been a 36 per cent reduction in the number of bestsellers, down from 28 to 18. This decline represents a lost opportunity to promote desirable items to new and existing customers. Behind the scenes, the decline could also lead to reduced purchasing power with suppliers and erode margins.</p>
<p class="text">With fewer product introductions and weaker performance of bestsellers, this business needs to:</p>
<ol class="list-number"><li><p class="list-number">ramp up the rate of new product introduction;</p></li>

<p class="text-fo">The way in which you organize and promote your product categories can have a significant impact on how well the products within those categories perform.</p>
<p class="text">Some simple analysis will immediately tell you which categories generate the most product views, add-to-baskets, orders and revenue. Once you know this, you can see which categories perform well in terms of converting visitors into viewing them, adding to basket and finally paying for them. You can also perform this analysis to reposition categories in your navigation to increase sales.</p>
<p class="text">To analyse the category performance, capture the following data:</p>
<ol class="list-number"><li><p class="list-number"><b>Category name</b> (eg sofas, lighting, kitchenware etc).</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number"><b>Category views</b>: Number of visits to the site that included a visit to the particular category.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number"><b>Product views</b>: The number of times that any product page was viewed within the same visit as the particular category page was viewed.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number"><b>Baskets</b>: Number of times that any product was added to the basket within the same visit as the category was viewed.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number"><b>Transactions</b>: Number of transactions that took place in the same visit as the category was viewed.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number"><b>Revenue</b>: Amount of revenue from orders placed in the same visit as the category was viewed.</p></li>

<p class="text-fo">While you get a clear overview of sales by category, you can study the visitors&#x2019; journey through a category onto a product page, into the basket and then through the checkout at a more granular level.

<p class="text">This discovery means you have an opportunity to improve this part of the customer journey for a particular category. For example, if you were to compare categories containing higher-priced items (such as sofas) with lower-priced items (such as lighting), you might discover that while both categories had similar Category: Basket ratios, the sofa category had a much lower Baskets: Order ratio.</p>
<p class="text">In other words, there is a barrier in the checkout part of the journey for sofa category visitors. This insight could prompt you to collect more data and take action to address the weaker performance in the checkout. For example, through using exit surveys, you might discover that delivery of <span id="page-110" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 110.

You can then hypothesize that providing reassurance about the quality of your delivery service to these visitors at this point in their journey would increase their Basket: Order ratio, and ultimately boost sales. A split test would give you the answer, and if you&#x2019;re right, you&#x2019;ll soon be selling more sofas.</p>

<p class="text">Proposed by Bryan Eisenberg,<sup><a href="#ch06_en5" id="ch06_enx5">5</a></sup> one of the earliest exponents of website optimization, this analysis is simple to do and yields great insights on your products based on how your website visitors behave. First decide whether you are going to do seasonal analysis, such as peak and non-peak, or over a 12-month period.</p>
<p class="text">To perform look-to-book analysis, you need the following information:</p>

<p id="ch06_tabskip_005" class="text-fo">This knowledge gives you a platform to decide which products to push (Segment A), which ones to get rid of (Segment D), and which ones need some attention (Segments B and C). So what sort of attention should you give them?</p>
<p class="text">For low-converting products that fall into segment B (high page views but low add-to-basket ratio), use online survey tools such as Qualaroo to understand why visitors are not adding items to their basket. Useful questions to ask include &#x2018;Is there any information missing on this product&#x2019;? or, more directly, &#x2018;Why didn&#x2019;t you add this item to your basket?&#x2019; The answers to this question will give you insight as how you can better merchandise these products.</p>
<p class="text">For high-converting products that fall into segment C (low product page views but high add-to-basket ratio), there is an opportunity to bundle products together with other bestsellers from segment A. This helps get them noticed and can encourage visitors to place larger orders, which will increase your average order value.</p>

<h2 id="ch06_h2_004" class="head-a">Price-point analysis</h2>
<p class="text-fo">This useful form of analysis was born out of a pre-internet offline technique called SQUINCH or &#x2018;square inch analysis&#x2019;, used by catalogue marketers. They would quite literally measure exactly how much space was given to each product in the catalogue and divide it by the revenue generated to assess which ones were paying their way, and which were taking up too much valuable room.</p>
<p class="text">To perform modern-day price-point analysis, first set out the total number of products at each price point. Ignore SKUs (eg colour and size variations) for the purposes of this analysis. The bands you use will depend on the spread of your product prices.</p>
<p class="text"><span id="page-113" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 113. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>If you find you have a lot of products all bunched into one or two price bands, use smaller bands. In the example in <a id="rch06_tab_007" href="#ch06_tab_007">Table 6.7</a>, most of the price points are set at &#x00A3;10 intervals, but at &#x00A3;30, the bands are only &#x00A3;5 (&#x00A3;30&#x2013;&#x00A3;34.99 and &#x00A3;35.00&#x2013;&#x00A3;39.99). This was done to avoid bunching, because nearly a third of products fall into the &#x00A3;30&#x2013;&#x00A3;39.99 band. Splitting this highly populated band into two gives a more even spread.</p>

<p id="ch06_tabskip_007" class="text-fo">Then capture the total number of orders for all the items included in each price band. You can then work out the percentage for items offered and items ordered, and the variance between the two. Your table will probably look something like <a href="#ch06_tab_007">Table 6.7</a>.</p>
<p class="text">Price-point analysis is designed to show you the price bands that your most popular products fall into. It is a message from your customers that gives a strong signal that you can offer them more items that cost that sort of price.</p>
<p class="text">In <a href="#ch06_tab_007">Table 6.7</a>, we can see that items in the price band of &#x00A3;50&#x2013;&#x00A3;59.99 make up just 2.5 per cent of total items offered, but comprise 6.3 per cent of total sales. This is a firm indication that you can increase the number of items offered at this price point.</p>
<p class="text">Conversely, the &#x00A3;10&#x2013;&#x00A3;19.99 bracket accounts for 13.9 per cent of all sales but 18.8 per cent of all items. This is where you could look to reduce the number of items you sell.</p>
<p class="text">However, do look at the bigger picture before delisting. Before making the final cut, check to see whether any of these items regularly appear in the first order a customer places with you. Removing popular items for first-time orders could have a detrimental effect on your ability to convert new visitors into first-time buyers.</p>

<h2 id="ch06_h2_005" class="head-a"><span id="page-114" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 114. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>Price testing</h2>
<p class="text-fo">As a rule of thumb, as the price increases, demand falls. However, people will almost always pay more for something if it&#x2019;s presented in the right way. The problem is that you never really know how much more unless you engage in some form of price testing.</p>
<p class="text">It&#x2019;s unreliable to simply ask people what they would be prepared to pay; consumers are notorious for saying one thing but doing another.</p>
<p class="text">As the pioneering ad agency founder David Ogilvy asserted: &#x2018;Customers don&#x2019;t know what they feel, don&#x2019;t say what they know, and don&#x2019;t do what they say. Market research is three steps removed from real behaviour.&#x2019;<sup><a href="#ch06_en6" id="ch06_enx6">6</a></sup></p>
<p class="text">Therefore, in order to understand how much you can charge for your products &#x2013; or their demand elasticity &#x2013; without losing sales, quantitative testing is more reliable.</p>
<p class="text">There are a number of ways you can do this, including increasing your prices and analysing the sales before and after the price increase. However, with this method it is difficult to trust the results because there could be several other factors at play.</p>
<p class="text">There is a way to use a scientific approach to price testing and discover the maximum price you can charge for selected products without harming overall demand. The last few years have seen the launch of a number of price-testing tools, including WisePricer and Tatvic. It&#x2019;s also something you can do with server-side experimentation platforms.</p>
<p class="text">Tatvic, for example, offers a service called LiftSuggest, which allows you to test one or more different prices to a proportion of your website visitors. You can then compare sales on both the higher- and lower-priced groups and see whether the higher price makes a difference. Although it&#x2019;s not actually illegal to offer the same product at two or more different prices at once, it&#x2019;s generally considered immoral, and consumers are outraged if they discover it.</p>
<p class="text">To avoid negatives of this kind, LiftSuggest reduces the price for the customer at the last minute. It does this by showing the higher price on the category and product pages only. Once the visitor has added the product to the basket, they are shown a message that tells them how to reduce the cost to get the lower price, such as &#x2018;Your price has been reduced by &#x00A3;x. Please click OK to continue&#x2019; (<a id="rch06_fig_001" href="#ch06_fig_001">Figure 6.1</a>).</p>
<figure class="figure" id="ch06_fig_001"><figcaption>
<p class="figure"><a href="#rch06_fig_001"><span class="label" epub:type="label"><span id="page-115" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 115. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>Figure</span> <span class="ordinal" epub:type="ordinal">6.1</span> Example of price reduction after higher-priced item has been added to basket</a></p>
</figcaption>
<p class="figure-media"><img src="images/M06NF001.jpg" alt="A screenshot of the congratulation dialog box reads &#x2018;we have reduced the price of this product. You can buy this product at 276.25 pound sterling now. Please click Continue&#x2019;. The continue button is given below."/></p>
</figure>
<p class="text-fo">The LiftSuggest reporting dashboard lets you see whether the add-to-basket ratio of the product offered at the higher price is different from the product offered at the base price. You may find that pricing a product 10 per cent higher does not lower the add-to-basket ratio, but when you price it 15 per cent higher, there is a reduction. This will give you the confidence that increasing your product&#x2019;s price by 10 per cent will not harm sales. Price testing in this way can also be used to evaluate the impact of cutting prices to see whether a lower price results in higher levels of gross margin.</p>
<p class="text">Price testing helps avoid under-pricing (where you give away too much margin) and overpricing (where you lose sales because the price puts too many people off). Either way, when you price test in an objective and scientific way, you&#x2019;ll optimize your revenue &#x2013; a key part of website optimization.</p>

<h2 id="ch06_h2_006" class="head-a">Summary</h2>
<p class="text-fo">Merchandising analytics is a range of valuable research techniques to use as part of your website optimization programme. It gives you useful insights into the interaction between your visitors, the merchandise you offer and the actions your visitors take.</p>
<p class="text">Using merchandising analytics allows you to determine the impact on sales of a declining rate of new product introduction, and how a fall in revenue from bestsellers over time could damage your business.</p>
<p class="text">Category analysis identifies poorly performing categories as well as the chance to understand underlying reasons. You can optimize your navigation for higher sales by examining which categories result in higher and lower levels of conversion and revenue.</p>
<p class="text">Look-to-book analysis is a simple and easy way to develop a strategy for each of your products based on the number of views they receive and how likely it is that they are added to the customer&#x2019;s basket.</p>
<p class="text"><span id="page-116" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 116. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>Using price-point analysis enables you to scientifically pinpoint where you have authority to sell more products in this price band, and the products that could be culled without damaging sales. Price testing gives you the opportunity to determine the maximum selling price without reducing order volume.</p>
<p class="text">For e-commerce businesses selling products, merchandising analytics can reveal insights that are often missing from optimization programmes. It&#x2019;s worth repeating on a regular (eg six-monthly or seasonal) basis.</p>
