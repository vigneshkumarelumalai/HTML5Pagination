<p class="text-fo">It&#x2019;s time to start digging for insights.</p>
<p class="text">In the previous chapter, we discussed the journey from data to insights by means of analysis. Over the next three chapters you will learn more about a number of research tools and methods, focused on generating actionable insights.</p>
<p class="text">You&#x2019;ll find that it&#x2019;s not a linear approach of moving from one data source to the next in an orderly sequence. More likely you will loop back to a data set at times, prompted by an insight from another piece of data. It&#x2019;s okay; that is the process.</p>
<p class="text">But where to begin? Analysis can be broken out into these key four areas,<sup><a href="#ch04_en1" id="ch04_enx1">1</a></sup> says Brent Dykes, author of two highly recommended books about analytics:</p>
<ul class="list"><li><p class="list"><b>Acquisition</b>: What are the primary sources of traffic? How do they compare in terms of sales activity? If your business pays for traffic, how does this &#x2018;bought traffic&#x2019; perform? If you can increase the conversion rates and average order values of paid traffic, it will have a big impact on ROI. E-mail is an area you have more control over than others, and in some organizations this presents a massive opportunity.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Site</b> <b>i</b><b>nteractions</b>: What is happening on your site? What are the dominant journeys? Which paths are more profitable, and which are most leaky? How easily are users able to carry out key tasks that lead up to the final conversion event?</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Conversion</b> <b>p</b><b>rocess</b>: Identify the roadblocks to conversion. Start by looking at the micro conversion events: activities higher up the funnel that build up to the transaction. Examples are finding and selecting products, adding to cart and navigating the site. Where in the journey do visitors become stuck? Where do they drop out of the funnel?</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Visitor</b> <b>v</b><b>alue</b>: In <a href="07_chapter01.xhtml#ch01_sec_001">Chapter 1</a> we introduced the concept of customer profitability. Not all your customers are equal in value. What are the different patterns between users who purchase and those who don&#x2019;t? Focus your efforts on customers that will give you the best long-term return.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="text-fo"><span id="page-38" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 38. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>In this chapter, we focus on data sources, tools and research methods to form a backdrop of behavioural insights. Where do they come from, what do they do, where do things go wrong?</p>
<p class="text">Remember to diligently document every noteworthy observation, and capture any questions and ideas before they are gone.</p>
<section aria-labelledby="ch04_h2_001">
<h2 id="ch04_h2_001" class="head-a">Website analytics</h2>
<p class="text-fo">You probably have Google Analytics (GA) installed on your site. In fact, you are probably already familiar with it and the types of reports it can generate.</p>
<p class="text">At the time of writing, industry rumours have it that GA is about to be comprehensively upgraded. The principles shared here are timeless, even if you find the platform has evolved significantly by the time you&#x2019;re reading this.</p>
<p class="text">GA is so vast that we could write an entire book on this topic alone. It also means that you can easily get stuck in analysis paralysis. Don&#x2019;t allow that to happen; look for answers to specific questions rather than aimlessly clicking about.</p>
<p class="text">When you feel that the outline of a story is starting to take shape, move on. GA analysis is something you can come back to at any time. There will be ample opportunity to work your way into the granular detail. Each time you return with fresh knowledge, gained from other data sources, your analysis is more fruitful.</p>
<p class="text">As you go along, make screenshots of any interesting reports. Export data sets from GA to Excel or Google Sheets for further analysis, maybe at a later point. This goes into the proverbial shoebox from <a href="09_chapter03.xhtml#ch03_sec_001">Chapter 3</a>, along with your notes and observations. There should be no pressure to walk away with any earth-shattering insights. Just record what you observe, take down relevant questions &#x2013; and answers if you can find them.</p>
<section aria-labelledby="ch04_h3_001">
<h3 id="ch04_h3_001" class="head-b">Get an overview</h3>
<p class="text-fo">If you are doing targeted research to explore a specific problem or opportunity, you will be guided by specific research questions as discussed in <a href="09_chapter03.xhtml#ch03_sec_001">Chapter 3</a>.</p>
<p class="text">If this is part of your exploratory research, start by dipping in and out of the various native GA reports. Cover all four analysis zones identified in the introduction to this chapter. Use a relatively broad date range, preferably a year to counter seasonal effects.</p>
<p class="text"><span id="page-39" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 39. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>Examples of questions of interest at this stage:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet">Where are your visitors coming from (source/medium)?</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">In which countries or regions are they? Are they what you would expect?</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">What devices are they using?</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Mostly Android or iOS, or something else?</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">What are the top three browsers?</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Where do visitors enter the site?</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Which are the most visited pages?</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Which pages have a high bounce rate?</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">On which pages are they leaving the site?</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Where in the checkout funnel are visitors dropping out?</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="text-fo">What are some questions that you want to know about the visitors to your website, and their behaviour? What assumptions do you hold that GA could help to validate or refute?</p>
</section>
<section aria-labelledby="ch04_h3_002">
<h3 id="ch04_h3_002" class="head-b">Conversion rate</h3>
<p class="text-fo">It&#x2019;s one of the biggest obsessions in e-commerce, yet absent from the list above: &#x2018;What is your conversion rate?&#x2019;</p>
<p class="text">We unpack this in a later chapter, but for now, let&#x2019;s jump straight to the punchline: <b>in isolation, conversion rate is a meaningless data point</b>. Let&#x2019;s say your conversion rate is 2 per cent or 5 per cent or whatever. What does it really mean? What can do you do with that information? How can you act on it?</p>
<p class="text">The first problem is that it is not a static number. Your Black Friday conversion rate is not the same as your post-Christmas conversion rate, which is not the same as your weekend conversion rate&#x2026; you get the point. So, without doing anything to your site, it goes up and down. Depending on when you put the dipstick into GA, you&#x2019;ll get a different value.</p>
<p class="text">Conversion rate is not a pointless metric <i>per se</i>; it is valuable if used wisely. For example, compare the conversion rate of different groups of users. Paid search converts worse than Organic? Ah, suddenly questions worth asking start popping out.</p>
<p class="text"><span id="page-40" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 40. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>Return to the list of questions in the section above. This time, compare the conversion rate of the top three to five segments in each of those reports. See anything interesting? Make a note of it. Does it trigger a few questions? Put them in the shoebox.</p>
</section>
<section aria-labelledby="ch04_h3_003">
<h3 id="ch04_h3_003" class="head-b">Segment the data</h3>
<p class="text-fo">Whatever GA reports you use, segmenting those data is the difference between wasting your time and using it productively. Analytics guru Avinash Kaushik doesn&#x2019;t mince his words: &#x2018;no segments, no insights, no job&#x2019;.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" role="doc-noteref" href="#ch04_en2" id="ch04_enx2">2</a></sup></p>
<p class="text">By default, GA reports are aggregates based on the activities of all your visitors. They hide important nuances in behaviour and how that affects performance. Segmentation reveals those individual groups, allowing you to compare the behaviour and commercial value of the various segments.</p>
<p class="text">If you&#x2019;re not yet sure exactly how to do this thing called &#x2018;analysis&#x2019; &#x2013; this is a key part of it. <b>Segment and compare</b> is how you learn about behaviour, and it&#x2019;s a good way to make sense of almost any data &#x2013; not just GA.</p>
<p class="text"><a id="rch04_fig_001" href="#ch04_fig_001">Figure 4.1</a> shows drop-off rates at various stages in the journey. Overall, 21 per cent of users are lost at the basket page. However, looking a bit deeper reveals a different picture. Most of that leakage comes from mobile users (30 per cent) and tablet users (34 per cent). On desktop, only 8 per cent are lost here.</p>

<p class="text-fo">GA gives you several options for creating segments, including:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet">inline segments;</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">advanced segments.</p></li>
</ul>
<section>
<h4 class="head-c">Inline segments</h4>
<p class="text-fo">This is a quick &#x2018;on-the-fly&#x2019; method. In <a id="rch04_fig_002" href="#ch04_fig_002">Figure 4.2</a>, we are getting more granular in the landing pages report by adding <i>Source/Medium</i> as a secondary dimension. Now, instead of seeing a list of pages where users entered the site, we&#x2019;ll see where they entered &#x2013; depending on where they came from.</p>

</figure>
</section>
<section>
<h4 class="head-c">Advanced segments</h4>
<p class="text-fo">An optimizer&#x2019;s best friend! Unlike inline segmentation, advanced segments are applied at a global level. You can really dig deep and use this feature to answer almost any question as long as the key attributes are available in GA.</p>
<p class="text"><span id="page-43" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 43. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>Set up advanced segments to compare the behaviour and performance of different groups of visitors. The list of potential segments is endless. You&#x2019;d have to think about the ones that would be useful in your own business.</p>

<li><p class="list-bullet">Customers vs non-customers</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">High-value vs low-value purchasers</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Users who completed specific actions on the site</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Users who visited a certain page</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Users who completed a specific series of actions</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Users/device who add to cart but don&#x2019;t convert</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Users/sessions with transactions</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Users/sessions with more than one transaction</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Device with transactions</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Lots of page views but no add-to-basket</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Users who used site search</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Desktop/mobile users who bought more than <i>x</i> times</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Users who spent between <i>x</i> and <i>y</i></p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Users who came from Facebook and whose first session was on <i>x</i> date</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Customers who bought product <i>x</i> after seeing page <i>y</i></p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Paid search traffic who saw advertisement <i>x</i> and then added a product to cart</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="text-fo">To start, click &#x2018;Add Segment&#x2019; at the top of the page next to the default &#x2018;All Users&#x2019;. This opens a window that looks similar to what you see in <a id="rch04_fig_003" href="#ch04_fig_003">Figure 4.3</a>. Here, we are creating a segment for users who purchased furniture, by specifying the relevant product categories. Build your own custom segments by mixing and matching various attributes.

<h3 id="ch04_h3_004" class="head-b"><span id="page-45" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 45. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>Funnel visualization</h3>
<p class="text-fo">If funnels have already been created in GA, you will be able to get a useful funnel visualization like the example shown in <a id="rch04_fig_004" href="#ch04_fig_004">Figure 4.4</a>. At a glance, you can see how visitors are moving through the steps and where they are dropping out, to identify the major leaks. It also shows where visitors are entering the various steps, on the left, and where they go when they abandon.</p>
<figure class="figure" id="ch04_fig_004"><figcaption>

</figcaption>
<p class="figure-media"><img src="images/M04NF004.jpg" alt="Screenshot of a webpage shows funnel visualization using Google Analytics. Shown here are two funnel shaped charts depicting the flow of visitors from cart to checkout and to checkout complete."/></p>
</figure>
<p class="text-fo">If funnels haven&#x2019;t been configured, this isn&#x2019;t hard to do and you&#x2019;ll find easy-to-follow instructions in the GA help files on the official website. Set up funnels for your checkout and other key journeys, for example PLP (product listing page) and PDP (product detail page) progression to basket.</p>
<p class="text">Assuming funnels have been set up, follow this path to generate a funnel visualization for your site:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="block-quote">Reports &#x003E; Conversions &#x003E; Goals &#x003E; Funnel Visualization, and then pick the relevant funnel from the Goal dropdown box at top left.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="text-fo">In this particular example, the checkout funnel has a conversion rate of 19.7 per cent &#x2013; out of all the visitors who start on the cart page, only 19.7 per cent of them eventually check out. The biggest drop-off is on the checkout page; almost 60 per cent abandoned the funnel at this point.</p>
<p class="text">Another very insightful visualization can be found in the checkout funnel report <i>Checkout Behaviour</i>. You will have access to this if <i>Enhanced E-commerce</i> has been added to your GA installation. If it hasn&#x2019;t been done, ask your developers to do this as soon as possible.</p>

<h2 id="ch04_h2_002" class="head-a">User journey mapping</h2>
<p class="text-fo">Built-in funnel visualization reports are insightful, but they&#x2019;re only accessible with some advanced configuration. Even then, the reports are only available from the day that they were created. This doesn&#x2019;t have to hold you back.</p>
<p class="text">Your visitors leave behind trails of data in GA that you can use to manually plot their paths through the site. This forms a good backdrop to the rest of your research. In fact, many e-commerce marketers say that journey mapping is their single most valuable tool.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" role="doc-noteref" href="#ch04_en3" id="ch04_enx3">3</a></sup></p>
<p class="text">A visualization of this data, as shown in <a href="#ch04_fig_001">Figure 4.1</a>, gives you a great behavioural overview and can expose leaks on your site. This often highlights areas for further investigation, and might give you an early steer on potential opportunities.</p>
<p class="text">A segmented view is always more meaningful than just looking at one block of aggregate data. Mapping out the differences between converting and non-converting segments can be very insightful. Think about what is most relevant for your particular context. The example in <a href="#ch04_fig_001">Figure 4.1</a> shows segmentation by device category. What jumps out at you? Certainly, the comparatively large drop-off on the basket page for mobile devices should prompt further examination.</p>
<p class="text">PDPs often have a high drop-off rate. It&#x2019;s natural for people to look at products without buying, several times. Before they buy they&#x2019;re searching for solutions, evaluating alternatives, doing price comparisons, and they even come back to it after the purchase. There is more on purchase decision making in <a href="19_chapter13.xhtml#ch13_sec_001">Chapter 13</a>.</p>
<section aria-labelledby="ch04_h3_006">
<h3 id="ch04_h3_006" class="head-b"><span id="page-48" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 48. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>Create a journey map in GA</h3>
<p class="text-fo">Identify the key pages that represent steps in your user journey. A typical e-commerce funnel looks something like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="block-quote">All Users &#x003E; Category Page &#x003E; Product Listing Page &#x003E; Product Detail Page &#x003E; Add to Cart &#x003E; Basket &#x003E; Checkout &#x003E; Transaction</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="text-fo">Use GA to count the number of visitors to each step in the journey. There are many different ways in which to access these data. An easy approach is to create a new <i>dashboard</i> in GA, adding a widget for each step of the journey. Use regular expressions (regex; you&#x2019;ll find helpful tools online) to group pages together for each template. Once you&#x2019;ve created a widget for each major step in the funnel, you can easily segment the journey by applying <i>advanced segments</i> and then export the result into Excel or Google Sheets for analysis.</p>
<p class="text">Another approach is to use the advanced segments feature, shown in <a href="#ch04_fig_003">Figure 4.3</a>. Go to <i>Sequences</i> on the left, then select &#x2018;Page&#x2019; from the dropdown options and gradually add all the pages in the funnel. As you add another step, make a note of the visitor and session numbers to the right.</p>
<p class="text">Use an extended time frame to account for seasonal differences. All that remains then is to calculate the drop-off rate between different steps and present it in an easy-to-understand visual.</p>
</section>
<section aria-labelledby="ch04_h3_007">
<h3 id="ch04_h3_007" class="head-b">Heatmaps</h3>
<p class="text-fo">This is a more visual representation of user activity, compared to analytics. That also makes it effective in presentations and in discussions with stakeholders. It&#x2019;s easy to understand and helps to create talking points around user behaviour.</p>
<p class="text">The reports are based on mouse movements (desktop) or finger movements (mobile), and show you how people interact with your pages. Examples are:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet">heatmaps</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">clickmaps</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">scrollmaps</p></li>

<li><p class="list-bullet">attention maps</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">gaze plot maps</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="text-fo">Clickmaps and heatmaps track where users click, scroll or tap on your website. Once you install the software, it runs on your site and monitors the mouse movements and click patterns of visitors. Reports are based on actual data (<a id="rch04_tab_001" href="#ch04_tab_001">Table 4.1</a>).</p>

<p id="ch04_tabskip_001" class="text-fo"><span id="page-51" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 51. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>Unlike GA, <b>heatmaps</b> show exactly where people clicked on a page, regardless of whether it&#x2019;s a link or not. The more clicks, the brighter the spot. It shows which elements on a page generate the most interest. Is it in line with what you would expect, or are there surprises? Are people clicking where you want them to click? Are they being distracted, or going down less profitable paths? If so, is it because of design, or does it possibly tell you something about your visitors&#x2019; goals, needs and intentions? What can you infer about user behaviour by looking at the distribution of clicks?</p>
<p class="text">As with most analysis, the most interesting jewels of insight are usually hidden in segmentation. Don&#x2019;t ever miss this trick. In the clickmap of the login page in <a id="rch04_fig_005" href="#ch04_fig_005">Figure 4.5</a>, new visitors are represented by darker (red) dots <span id="page-52" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 52. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>and returning visitors by white dots. A large number of new visitors appear to be interacting with the login area. This prompts the question &#x2013; why? Surely, if they were new to the site, they would not previously have registered an account to log into. This insight may lead to the hypothesis that the distinction is not clear enough and should be better messaged.</p>

<h3 id="ch04_h3_008" class="head-b">Scrollmaps</h3>
<p class="text-fo">The idea behind <b>scrollmaps</b> is to show you how far down the page visitors scroll, and where on the page they are spending most of their time. It&#x2019;s always interesting to see how much of what happens &#x2018;below the fold&#x2019; is noticed. The fold is a concept inherited from newspapers, which are of course literally folded in half on the newsstand. Passers-by can see only the top half of the page, which is meant to grab the attention. In a similar way, only the top section of your web page is visible when a user first looks at it. On a mobile device, an even smaller portion is in the initial view. Does it work hard enough in generating interest? What percentage of people see key content if it&#x2019;s further down the page? Are there any areas lower down that receive a lot of attention? Why would that be &#x2013; what does it say about user needs that they seek it out? And should you elevate that content?</p>
<p class="text">If you integrate the heat- and scrollmap tool with your experimentation platform, you&#x2019;ll be able to compare user behaviour with test variations against the control. This can be very helpful in figuring out how the variation changes behaviour. Some testing platforms, like VWO, have built-in heatmapping capabilities. Others, like Optimizely, integrate smoothly with Crazy Egg or some of the alternatives listed below.</p>

</ul>
<p class="text-fo">Some of these offer much more than just heat- and scrollmaps. Hotjar is a popular tool that also includes funnel analysis, form analysis and on-site surveys. VWO is an experimentation platform with a range of discovery tools around it.</p>
<p class="text">Enterprise tools, like Sessioncam and Clicktale, incorporate AI (artificial intelligence), which does much of the hard work for you in the background. Sessioncam, for example, has an algorithm that flags recordings (covered below) of sessions with poor user experience.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section aria-labelledby="ch04_h2_003">
<h2 id="ch04_h2_003" class="head-a">Session replay</h2>
<p class="text-fo">You can learn a lot by watching actual people using your site. Session replay consists of video clips of mouse and finger movements, from when the user starts a session to where they leave the site. Most of the heatmap software listed above also offers session replay.</p>
<p class="text">Captured by always-on software, recordings are made of every interaction by each visitor who meets your specified criteria. For example, the recording can start when a user arrives on a specific page, or when they click on a certain button on that page. Set criteria based on your insights from elsewhere and any research questions you may have. At a minimum, make sure you have activated session replay for the main device categories on key pages and templates &#x2013; homepage, PLP, PDP, basket and so on.</p>
<p class="text">Rather than static images, the videos show how the mouse/finger moves around the page, where they click or tap, where there&#x2019;s hesitation and backtracking. You see the exact sequence of these events, which heatmaps can&#x2019;t give you. More importantly, you can see how the site responds to that user interaction, which can surface usability issues, errors and unexpected behaviours.</p>
<p class="text">Watching these clips can be revealing, but it can quickly become an unproductive time sink if not managed properly. To avoid aimlessly playing everything from beginning to end, have a plan.</p>
<p class="text"><span id="page-54" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 54. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>First, decide which touchpoints in the journey you want to analyse and then filter videos by URL. Use insights from GA to guide the investigation, so you might target areas with a high drop-off rate or bounce rate. Then, apply the segment-and-compare strategy mentioned earlier.</p>
<p class="text">Now you&#x2019;re ready to play the clips back to back at high speed. There&#x2019;s no need to watch every single clip. Soon, you&#x2019;ll start noticing behavioural patterns. Different segments of users behave differently. As always, make a note of every observation, linking it back to segment, device and area of the site.</p>
<aside id="ch04_aside_001" class="case-study" role="complementary" epub:type="case-study" aria-labelledby="ch11_boxtitle_004">

<h3 id="ch11_boxtitle_004" class="title txt-capitalize" epub:type="title"><b>Case Study</b></h3>
<p class="text-fo">One of our clients, a well-known retailer, redesigned their mobile site. In GA, we noticed a small increase in visitors abandoning PDPs of clothing products. All other categories were performing better, but fashion is one of the main revenue drivers, so this was a problem.</p>
<p class="text">To understand why this was happening, we filtered session recordings for mobile visitors who abandoned the PDP without clicking the &#x2018;Add to Cart&#x2019; button. It didn&#x2019;t take long to discover two separate problems.</p>
<p class="text">The first was a general usability issue. Immediately below the product image is the quantity selector and &#x2018;Add to Cart&#x2019; button. Almost a third of abandoning users were tapping the quantity selector repeatedly, but couldn&#x2019;t get the dropdown to work. They didn&#x2019;t realize they first had to pick colour and size &#x2013; and to do that, they would simply have to scroll down. Out of sight, out of mind.</p>
<p class="text">The second issue was a bug. The quantity button genuinely did not work if they used a certain phone model and browser combination. Even if the user had selected colour and size, the button did not respond. Because the session replay software gives you those details, we were able to pin it down and have the client&#x2019;s developers apply an urgent fix for that segment of users.</p>

<h2 id="ch04_h2_004" class="head-a">Usability testing</h2>
<p class="text-fo">GA and heatmaps are excellent ways of finding out what is happening on your site, and to surface opportunities for optimization. It tells you what is happening, but not why. Without further information about the observed problem, it&#x2019;s hard to figure out how to solve it. Often, you can fill in the gaps with usability testing.</p>
<p class="text"><span id="page-55" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 55. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>Imagine the knowledge you would gain if you could be a fly on the wall when a visitor is using your site, if you could somehow hear what they are thinking at the same time. That could give you a great insight into the roadblocks on the path to conversions.</p>
<p class="text">This is exactly what usability testing is &#x2013; observing users interacting with your site or app while verbalizing their thoughts. One thing to be absolutely firm on: it is never a test of the user! You are testing usability.</p>
<p class="text">The official definition of usability, according to the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), is: &#x2018;(the) extent to which a system&#x2026; can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals with effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction in a specified context of use&#x2019;.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" role="doc-noteref" href="#ch04_en4" id="ch04_enx4">4</a></sup> In plain English: can your users do what they want to do on your site, without suffering too much frustration?</p>
<p class="text">Officially, usability testing is a way to assess &#x2018;effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction&#x2019; in relation to carrying out tasks on the site. In practice, it&#x2019;s simply this: see where users are getting stuck, why it&#x2019;s happening and get specific ideas to improve the journey.</p>
<p class="text"><b>Formative</b> usability testing is used to find and fix issues, whereas <b>summative</b> usability testing is more descriptive, for example measuring and comparing usability.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" role="doc-noteref" href="#ch04_en5" id="ch04_enx5">5</a></sup> E-commerce optimization tends to rely more on the formative type, but summative can come in useful if you want to explore specific problems in more detail. An interesting exercise is doing usability testing on competitor sites, and here summative will be better at facilitating a comparison.</p>
<p class="text">Within these two broad divisions, there are several different approaches to conducting usability testing, as explained below.</p>
<section aria-labelledby="ch04_h3_009">
<h3 id="ch04_h3_009" class="head-b">Remote vs on-site</h3>
<p class="text-fo">At one time, all usability testing was done in a laboratory. Research subjects would take time out of their day to visit the lab and conduct the test, while being observed from behind one-way glass. It was hugely expensive as well as being an artificial environment, which may cause users to behave differently from how they would at home.</p>
<p class="text">Lab-based testing definitely still has its place, but it&#x2019;s not the only option or even the best one. The travel site <a href="https://www.booking.com/"><span class="url-hyperlink">Booking.com</span></a>, known for their strong experimentation and optimization culture, use different approaches:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="block-quote">Our product teams can order funnel tests in our lab, where they observe how people navigate through the website, what they think, and how they struggle. It&#x2019;s very powerful for teams to see this, especially when they think a new function is obvious but users don&#x2019;t understand it. Tests at users&#x2019; homes show us how they <span id="page-56" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 56. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>behave with our product in their own environment, spending their own money. We run tests on the street, in bars, and in caf&#x00E9;s here in Amsterdam. We show mockups, so people can try a new user interface. (Gerben Langendijk, <a href="https://www.booking.com/"><span class="url-hyperlink">Booking.com</span></a><sup><a href="#ch04_en6" id="ch04_enx6">6</a></sup>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="text-fo">Nowadays, it&#x2019;s easy to do this exercise remotely, without the need for a specialized lab environment. Quite literally, you can be on the other side of the world, talking to a customer, in their home, watching how they use your site.</p>
<p class="text">Remote usability studies can be facilitated by a moderator, or be unmoderated. Let&#x2019;s look at the difference.</p>
</section>
<section aria-labelledby="ch04_h3_010">
<h3 id="ch04_h3_010" class="head-b">Unmoderated</h3>
<p class="text-fo">Unmoderated testing is quick and inexpensive thanks to automated platforms like the ones listed here:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet"><a href="https://www.usertesting.com/"><span class="url-hyperlink">usertesting.com</span></a></p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Loop11</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Userzoom</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet"><a href="https://www.trymyui.com/"><span class="url-hyperlink">trymyui.com</span></a></p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Validately</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="text-fo">Typically lasting just a few minutes per session, participants log in from their own home at a time of their choosing and carry out specific tasks, speaking their thoughts out loud.</p>
<p class="text">Their voice and all on-screen activities are recorded for you to watch later. All the platforms offer a feature where you can create short video clips of relevant observations to share with your team and management. This is a powerful tool that we encourage you to use.</p>
<section>
<h4 class="head-c">Setting the tasks</h4>
<p class="text-fo">At the start of the session, give the participant tasks to perform. These should be linked to the goals of your website. For example, in order to make a purchase on your site, users should be able to find a suitable product and add it to their cart. Marieke McCloskey offers the following guidelines for setting meaningful tasks:<sup><a href="#ch04_en7" id="ch04_enx7">7</a></sup></p>
<ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet">Set the task in a scenario, rather than issuing a blunt instruction without any context. So rather than just &#x2018;Buy a bunch of flowers&#x2019;, say, &#x2018;Imagine that it&#x2019;s your mum&#x2019;s birthday tomorrow, and you want to have flowers delivered to her house. Visit <a href="http://my-flowers-site.com/"><span class="url-hyperlink">my-flowers-site.com</span></a> and choose something that you think your mum would like.&#x2019;</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet"><span id="page-57" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 57. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>Keep it realistic for the user. The example above is not too prescriptive about either the item to be purchased or amount to be spent. This gives users the freedom to adapt the task to their circumstances and encourages natural behaviour. Asking someone to buy a particular bouquet in this case would be too specific. It may be that a user dislikes that type of flower and would never buy them in real life.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Make it actionable. Don&#x2019;t ask users what they would do. Ask them to do it. Continuing the example from above, they have to click their way through the journey rather than explain what they would do next.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Don&#x2019;t explain the process in too much detail or list the steps to be followed, as this could give them clues on what to do. Since they don&#x2019;t have that benefit in real life, usability problems may not come to light if you hold their hand. Instead of &#x2018;Add the item to your basket, then click on the green button at the bottom of the screen&#x2019;, simply state: &#x2018;Proceed to buy the item.&#x2019;</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section>
<h4 class="head-c">Selecting your participants</h4>
<p class="text-fo">Finding people to test is easy when you use automated platforms, because they offer ever-growing networks of testers ready and willing to take part.</p>
<p class="text">Be warned, though, that this can be a double-edged sword: those testers are not necessarily representative of your visitors and customers. Many panellists are doing it semi-professionally, which can result in responses coming across as predictable and rehearsed. Some panels seem to attract individuals from a design or UX background who can&#x2019;t resist giving &#x2018;professional&#x2019; advice, rather than reflecting on their own individual experience. Unfortunately, though well meant, that input is worthless.</p>
<p class="text">The way around this problem is to screen your panel, which is a standard feature on these platforms. Don&#x2019;t rely only on basic demographic profiling alone; include custom questions to get as close as possible to your target customers. One of our clients sell products aimed at mothers of young children. We would ask a screening question like &#x2018;Do you have any children under the age of two?&#x2019; You can also use these questions to filter out undesirable tester profiles; for example, &#x2018;Do you have a background in design or UX?&#x2019;</p>
</section>
</section>
<section aria-labelledby="ch04_h3_011">
<h3 id="ch04_h3_011" class="head-b">Moderated</h3>
<p class="text-fo">As the name suggests, moderated usability testing refers to the study being conducted in the presence of a facilitator. Instead of the user completing the tasks on their own, they do it while someone is watching. That someone is you, or a team member.</p>
<p class="text"><span id="page-58" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 58. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>It can be done in person, at your office for example, or remotely using simple technology &#x2013; nothing more than phone and screen-sharing tools like GoToMeeting, Zoom and Adobe Connect. We have even used Skype and Google Hangouts, although both require accounts and may be a barrier for some as these tools can represent personal space.</p>
<p class="text">The advantage of moderated usability testing is that you can interact with the participant and ask follow-up questions, like &#x2018;what did you mean by that&#x2019; or &#x2018;could you say a bit more about why you think that&#x2019;. It allows you to explore unexpected paths, which can be extremely valuable.</p>
<p class="text">This &#x2018;go with the flow&#x2019; aspect has led to some of our greatest insights and discoveries. During one study, for a well-known bakery chain, the moderator observed that the user was struggling to carry out the task of ordering fresh cakes from the website. The moderator gently explored why this was, being careful not to give specific instructions like &#x2018;why don&#x2019;t you click there?&#x2019;</p>
<p class="text">Eventually the user remarked: &#x2018;What?! You mean I can actually order these cakes online and have them delivered to me?&#x2019; At this point, it dawned on the moderator that despite lots of visual clues, such as a basket icon and banners about delivery, it had not even occurred to the user that it was possible to buy fresh cakes online. It seemed obvious to the client, but was clearly not obvious to all users.</p>
<p class="text">This was an &#x2018;Aha!&#x2019; moment that would not have surfaced in an unmoderated setting. It also required the researcher to recognize it as a valuable insight and not dismiss the user as an idiot. This casual remark was developed into the hypothesis that sales would go up if more visitors were made explicitly aware that they could buy from the site.</p>
<p class="text">A simple experiment was developed in which everything was the same as before, apart from an additional headline on the homepage saying &#x2018;Shop online now &#x2013; from our bakery to your door&#x2019;. These nine words delivered an 18 per cent increase in revenue per visitor. It led to a series of tests, challenging a core assumption everyone had &#x2013; that users actually knew they could order fresh cakes online.</p>
<section>
<h4 class="head-c">Recruiting the panel</h4>
<p class="text-fo">To recruit people for usability testing, we recommend that you intercept users on your site as they are actually using it. This allows you to observe a truly authentic experience. Known as live recruiting, two popular tools are Ethnio and Hotjar. They serve a pop-up to users like the one shown in <a id="rch04_fig_006" href="#ch04_fig_006">Figure 4.6</a> and when someone responds, you can call them immediately and conduct the session right there and then.</p>
<figure class="figure" id="ch04_fig_006"><figcaption>
<p class="figure"><a href="#rch04_fig_006"><span class="label" epub:type="label"><span id="page-59" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 59. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>Figure</span> <span class="ordinal" epub:type="ordinal">4.6</span> Example of a pop-up served by Ethnio to recruit usability testing participants in real time</a></p>
</figcaption>
<p class="figure-media"><img src="images/M04NF006.jpg" alt="A sample pop-up window for usability test on Thompson and Morgan webpage by Ethnio."/></p>
</figure>
<p class="text-fo">If live recruiting is not possible, you can reach out to your database by e-mail or telephone. Regardless of the method you use, it&#x2019;s a good idea to offer a small incentive, usually a gift voucher to spend on the site. It will increase your response rate, and it&#x2019;s also fair to thank people and compensate them for their time &#x2013; which should be limited to no more than 15 minutes. Detractors of this inducement say that it can skew the results, but it&#x2019;s still better than not having any data.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h4 class="head-c">How to conduct a session</h4>
<p class="text-fo">Once you&#x2019;ve found a participant via live recruiting, phone them up right away and direct them to the screen-sharing facility. Ask them to continue the session as though you weren&#x2019;t there.</p>
<p class="text">A big difference between recruiting from your own customer base, as opposed to using panels, is that this is probably a new experience for them. They don&#x2019;t know anything about usability testing. Use the first few minutes to help them feel at ease and explain the rules of engagement carefully:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet">This is a test of the website, not of the user. If they find something confusing or problematic, there are other people who will have the same experience.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Reassure them that you can see only what they are sharing with you. If at any point they feel uncomfortable for whatever reason, they may stop the session immediately.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet"><span id="page-60" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 60. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>It is very important that they share with you what is going through their mind, even if they feel it is irrelevant.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="text-fo">Your role then is to observe, listen and take notes. This is important: have them speak their thoughts out loud. Don&#x2019;t interrupt! And don&#x2019;t guide them.</p>

<h3 id="ch04_h3_012" class="head-b">Quantitative and qualitative insights</h3>
<p class="text-fo">Usability testing really shines in its ability to generate qualitative insights, but quantification is still possible.</p>
<p class="text">It is especially common with summative usability testing, given the nature of its being more descriptive. Two metrics that are often used in this type of analysis are task completion rate and time on task.</p>
<p class="text"><b>Task completion rate</b> simply measures how many participants managed to complete the task. It is expressed as the percentage of successful attempts. To measure <b>time on task</b>, record how long it takes for each user to complete the task. This is mainly used for benchmarking and comparison.</p>
<p class="text">To do quantitative analysis effectively requires slightly bigger sample sizes. For this reason, remote unmoderated usability testing lends itself well to quantitative analysis, as it&#x2019;s easier to increase panel size.</p>

<section aria-labelledby="ch04_h3_013">
<h3 id="ch04_h3_013" class="head-b">Documenting insights</h3>
<p class="text-fo">It shouldn&#x2019;t be necessary to say this, but jot down every observation. One thing worse than not doing usability testing is wasting the opportunity by not keeping notes diligently. Include verbatim quotes to provide colour to your observations; it&#x2019;s an effective way to underscore an insight.</p>
<p class="text">A simple system that works well for us is using a spreadsheet similar to <a id="rch04_tab_002" href="#ch04_tab_002">Table 4.2</a>. Each unique observation is captured on a separate row, while each column represents a participant in the study. You can see at a glance which users experienced which issues. In the example in the table, User 1 encountered three issues compared to only one for User 3. Observation 2 was experienced by all users.</p>

<p id="ch04_tabskip_002" class="text-fo">The last column adds up the total for each row. While this may be an indication of how widespread an issue is, be careful of reading too much into it. You&#x2019;ll mostly be working with small samples, and the purpose of this exercise is not to make statistically robust inferences.</p>
<p class="text">Still, if you count the number of occurrences per observation, it can be used as a signal of importance. It is also good practice to assign a <b>severity rank</b> to each issue. Keep it simple, for example:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet"><b>Major</b>: A show stopper. The user is unlikely to continue beyond this point, so the task cannot be successfully completed.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet"><b>Moderate</b>: The task may still be successfully completed, but this issue causes user frustration and delays.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet"><b>Minor</b>: Minor irritation, but the conversion is not jeopardized.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="text-fo">Severity, and to some extent occurrence rate, can help you to prioritize the issues you&#x2019;ve observed.</p>

<h3 id="ch04_h3_014" class="head-b">How many users do you need?</h3>
<p class="text-fo">When you are doing formative usability testing as part of a broad exploration, don&#x2019;t stress about sample size.</p>
<p class="text">An often-quoted statistic comes from the seminal work of Jakob Nielsen and Tom Landauer.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" role="doc-noteref" href="#ch04_en8" id="ch04_enx8">8</a></sup> They found that just five testers reveal 85 per cent of a site&#x2019;s usability issues, after which the law of diminishing returns sets in. They also make the point that one is better than none, which is a good way of saying that the focus should be on finding insights rather than chasing sample quotas.</p>
<p class="text"><span id="page-62" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 62. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>There is a caveat to the five-user rule. When you have two or more distinct groups of users, it&#x2019;s good practice to include representatives from each group. If you have created personas, a topic for the next chapter, aim to test three or four users from the core persona groupings. If your study spans different device categories, our advice is to target mobile and desktop separately, with three to five users on each.</p>
<p class="text">Try to do follow-up studies throughout the optimization lifecycle and as you make changes to the site. At the very least it may validate some of your interventions, but invariably fresh opportunities will emerge. It&#x2019;s better to do more frequent sessions of smaller batches.</p>

<p class="text">Some optimizers start the ideation process with heuristic evaluation. Often it&#x2019;s nothing more than one person&#x2019;s subjective opinion about the site. In our view it&#x2019;s more effective to do this if you already have some data and insights to bring to the exercise.</p>

<section>
<h4 class="head-c">Motivation</h4>
<p class="text-fo">People buy stuff because they have a need. They need to solve a problem, or to get something done. Harvard marketing professor Theodore Levitt famously said: &#x2018;People don&#x2019;t want to buy a quarter-inch drill. They want a quarter-inch hole!&#x2019;<sup><a href="#ch04_en9" id="ch04_enx9">9</a></sup></p>
<p class="text"><span id="page-63" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 63. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>The stronger that need, the more motivated they are to purchase. You can uncover the needs and motivations of your customers by using the research methodologies covered in <a href="11_chapter05.xhtml#ch05_sec_001">Chapter 5</a>.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h4 class="head-c">Value proposition</h4>
<p class="text-fo">Strong motivation to purchase is not enough to clinch the sale, partly because the consumer has alternatives. They could buy from a competitor, or choose to do nothing at all.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="block-quote">Value proposition = Perceived benefit &#x2212; Perceived cost</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="text-fo">Note it&#x2019;s all about perception. What you and your team think about value is far less important than what your customer values. Through user research, you can determine what your customers find valuable. For the purpose of the heuristic evaluation, check the following:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet">Does your copy pass the &#x2018;so what&#x2019; test?</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Why should someone buy this product from your site? Are you giving visitors compelling reasons?</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Is the value proposition easy to understand?</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Is it communicated and articulated well?</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">How does it stack up against the customer&#x2019;s expectations of value?</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Is it clear what difference the purchase will make in their lives?</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">How does it compare against the value propositions of competitors?</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Is there a sense of uniqueness, of differentiation?</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section>
<h4 class="head-c">Relevance</h4>
<p class="text-fo">All consumers are tuned into the same radio station &#x2013; WII.FM (What&#x2019;s In It For Me?)</p>
<p class="text">We often hear that people don&#x2019;t read on the web. That&#x2019;s not true. People read if it&#x2019;s relevant to them. Unfortunately, web copy is often badly written, hence it doesn&#x2019;t get read.</p>
<p class="text">Are the key messages relevant to the visitor, in the context of their motivation and need? Are they aligned with expectations created upstream, for example in search advertising campaigns? Is it specific and unambiguous?</p>
<p class="text">For example, if I clicked on an advert that promises a 50 per cent discount, is that promise carried forward to the page that I arrive on? Do I see a reinforcing message with links to the marked-down products? If not, there&#x2019;s a potential disruption of that initial thought pattern.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h4 class="head-c"><span id="page-64" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 64. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>Incentive/urgency</h4>
<p class="text-fo">Hotel booking sites use the urgency principle very effectively. By showing you how many other people are looking at the same hotel &#x2013; and, by the way, only one room is left &#x2013; you know that you have to act quickly.</p>
<p class="text">Robert Cialdini points out that, on the whole, people want to maximize gain and minimize cost<sup><a href="#ch04_en10" id="ch04_enx10">10</a></sup> (see <a href="19_chapter13.xhtml#ch13_sec_001">Chapter 13</a>). Is anything offered to sweeten the deal, or to make the user act now instead of delaying?</p>
<p class="text">Often, these mechanisms already exist, but can be improved or amplified. For example, the incentive might be presented at the wrong time in the decision-making process. Or it might not be communicated compellingly enough.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h4 class="head-c">Distractions/attention</h4>
<p class="text-fo">Humans have a limited attention span. Treat it as a scarce resource! Every additional design element and call to action potentially adds to cognitive load. This hampers a user&#x2019;s decision-making process and may cause them to abandon altogether.</p>
<p class="text">Which elements on the page could be diverting attention from the main objectives? For example, links in the main navigation, or other calls to action, can lead users down a side path further away from a sale. Heatmaps are useful tools when trying to identify distractions.</p>
<p class="text">You can also use tools like Eye Quant and Feng-GUI. They use predictive algorithms to reflect on the ability of a design to distribute attention effectively (<a id="rch04_fig_007" href="#ch04_fig_007">Figure 4.7</a>). These tools will show you which parts are most likely to be seen within the first few seconds, and where users are most likely to look.</p>

</section>
<section>
<h4 class="head-c">Anxiety/friction</h4>
<p class="text-fo">These are negative forces that get in the way of conversions, even when a user is highly motivated. Reducing anxiety and friction is one of the most common ways of improving the conversion rate.</p>
<p class="text">The difference between the two is that anxiety plays out in the user&#x2019;s mind, whereas friction comes from the web page. Wondering whether fragile goods will arrive undamaged may cause anxiety. Being confronted by a long, badly designed form is an example of friction, as it increases the effort required by the user.</p>
<p class="text">If you have identified pages with a high drop-off rate or exit rate, chances are that users are experiencing one of these forces. Do you see anything on the page that can potentially cause FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt)? Is there any part of the process that can be simpler?</p>
<p class="text"><span id="page-66" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 66. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>Session replay analysis can expose areas of friction. Similarly, you can explore hypotheses about friction and anxiety with usability testing.</p>

<h3 id="ch04_h3_016" class="head-b">Setting up for heuristics evaluation</h3>
<p class="text-fo">It&#x2019;s not uncommon for businesses to employ a consultant to tell them what&#x2019;s wrong with their site, or where the opportunities are. No matter how qualified and experienced that person may be, they can&#x2019;t give you that answer. Nobody can.</p>
<p class="text">The importance of having a diverse number of inputs was amply illustrated by an experiment conducted by Jakob Nielsen. He asked 19 evaluators to work together, and they found 16 usability issues. No one picked up every issue, and some evaluators spotted as few as three. The results are shown in <a id="rch04_fig_008" href="#ch04_fig_008">Figure 4.8</a>, with black squares representing an issue that was spotted, and white those that were missed.</p>

<p class="figure-alt-long">A grid diagram shows usability problems on the horizontal axis from easy to hard, and evaluators on the vertical axis from successful to unsuccessful. The grid is filled with black and white squares representing issues identified and issues missed respectively.</p>
</details>
</figure>
<p class="text-fo">Looking at the top row, you&#x2019;ll see that the least successful evaluator found only 3 out of a possible 16 issues. On the far left of the chart, where the more hard-to-spot issues are plotted, there are only two black squares, indicating that they were picked up by only two evaluators. Overall, there are far more white squares than black, testament to just how difficult it can be. In fact, Nielsen also discovered that an evaluator typically finds only around a third of usability problems.</p>
<p class="text"><span id="page-67" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 67. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>To get the best results with heuristic evaluation, follow these guidelines:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet"><b>Use two or more people</b>. Different issues will be picked up by different individuals. Nielsen suggests using three to five.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet"><b>Work collaboratively</b>. One school of thought favours independent evaluations so that individuals aren&#x2019;t influenced by each other, but our experience is that a collaborative effort works well. Having evaluators together in one session avoids duplication and saves time. Issues can be discussed and prioritized in real time. You don&#x2019;t even have to have everyone in one room. With video conferencing or screen-sharing, a group heuristic evaluation is just as effective when done remotely, but always have one person keeping track of all the insights as they emerge.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet"><b>Use a framework</b>. The point of the exercise is not for each person to list what they dislike about the site. Systematically work through recognized heuristic principles, which brings clarity and focus to the evaluation.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="text-fo">To conduct a group heuristic evaluation, start by issuing a brief containing the following:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet"><b>URL of the site</b>, or of specific pages if you&#x2019;re limiting it to an area of the site. Presumably this is your own site, but nothing prevents you from making this exercise part of competitor analysis.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet"><b>Framework</b> to be used. Have everyone use the same framework, or give them the same list of heuristics.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet"><b>Personas</b>. Try to imagine yourself in the world of a customer. What are they trying to do on the site?</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet"><b>Tasks</b> that the evaluator has to perform. These can be based on the most dominant, or broken, journeys obtained from GA analysis.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet"><b>Device</b>. Try to cover a range of devices.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="text-fo">Collect responses either individually or in a group. If done individually, give everyone a template where they can list all the issues and opportunities they notice under relevant headings. A good method is to use a screen capture tool to take and annotate screen grabs. If evaluators collaborate, then have one person aggregate everything in real time.</p>

<p class="text">This can be done as an extension of heuristic evaluation. Place an order, just as if you were a customer; the only difference is that you log each step and take notice of your actions, feelings and observations. Your aim is to inspect the entire purchase chain, including the checkout process as well as the post-purchase experience. Screenshot the process, and look at any e-mails or other communication as part of your transaction.</p>
<p class="text">Often, the last mile is owned by a courier service. For a pure-play &#x000A;e-commerce business, that may be the only human interface with the customer. Many people won&#x2019;t make a distinction between your business and the carrier, so what impression is left? Try to return the item. How easy or cumbersome is that?</p>
<p class="text">Compare the reality you experience to the messaging and promises on the site. Does it match up? Is there something in the experience you can improve? Are there positive elements around the fulfilment currently not reflected online? For example, one of our clients had a white-glove delivery service that we discovered by chance after placing an order.

<p class="text">You can also see how demand is influenced by seasonality. To find out, export the top unique searches for each month over the last year from GA. Then stitch them together in 12 columns, one for each month. What patterns do you pick up?</p>
<p class="text">With a little extra configuration, you can track failed searches in GA. This will show you which search queries return no results. Are products not showing because they&#x2019;re not in stock, or has something else gone wrong? If you don&#x2019;t carry the products that users are searching for, is that an opportunity? What has brought your visitors to your site under the impression that they can buy something from you that you don&#x2019;t stock?</p>
<p class="text">Looking at the pages your users were on when they started their search will give you different insights. Are there any surprises when you look at this report? For example, what does it mean if a lot of people search for things from the product detail pages? Are they not finding what they were looking for? How do search patterns differ between page templates? For example, do people in the checkout funnel search for delivery information?</p>

<h2 id="ch04_h2_008" class="head-a">Form analysis</h2>
<p class="text-fo">How much do you like filling in forms? Nobody does, and yet forms are central in many online journeys. It&#x2019;s easy to see how they can get in the way of conversions. To illustrate this, an analysis of data from 650,000 form users revealed that the conversion rate for Order/Payment forms averaged only 9 per cent!<sup><a href="#ch04_en13" id="ch04_enx13">13</a></sup></p>
<p class="text">Assess the performance of pages containing forms in GA. First, review top-level indicators for those pages, such as bounce rate, exit rate and drop-off rate. This will give you some context and direction in terms of which forms to analyse and prioritize. As for the forms, check the following:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet">How many people saw the form?</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">How many started filling it out?</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet"><span id="page-71" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 71. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>How many completed the form?</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Which fields caused users to abandon?</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="text-fo">The good news is that all of these data can be made available to you by setting up event tracking in GA, which involves just a tiny bit of technical work for your developer.</p>
<p class="text">Another approach may be to use a tool designed for this purpose. These tools can show you things like which fields cause the most hesitation, where errors occur and identify the fields that lead to abandonment. If forms are an important part of your visitor journey, it may be worth investing in bespoke form analysis software like Formisimo. It&#x2019;s also included in some other tools like Hotjar and Clicktale.</p>
<p class="text">Session replays, discussed in detail earlier, can also come in handy. Filter recordings of people interacting with the form. You should spot the issues as you review the clips: where people pause, errors that come up, and where they abandon.</p>
<p class="text">Finally, build forms into your heuristic evaluation. Here are some principles, which you could use as a basis for the evaluation:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet"><b>Form length</b>. The more fields, the more daunting the task will appear. Every field has to justify its existence. Ask of each one, why do you need it? Is it to the benefit of the business or the user?</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet"><b>Layout</b>. Would a single-column form with the field name above be better than two columns with the field name to the side?</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet"><b>Nomenclature</b>. What you call a part of the form can make a difference as to how people react. For example, &#x2018;verification required&#x2019; may be off-putting, whereas &#x2018;activate now&#x2019; sounds perhaps more inviting.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet"><b>Phone number</b>. People generally resist sharing their phone number. If you need it, could you tell the user why it&#x2019;s in their interest to provide it? For example, &#x2018;We may call you to schedule delivery.&#x2019;</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet"><b>CAPTCHA</b>. Do you really need it? What is the risk in dropping it? If you can&#x2019;t do without it, make it as easy as possible. A simple puzzle like &#x2018;3&#x002B;1=&#x2019; means they only have to type in one digit, not a string that you struggle to read. Even better, just a tick-box to indicate they&#x2019;re not a bot.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet"><b>Error messages</b>. Is the error message specific to the error? Does it leave the user with clear instructions on how to recover? Does the message make it sound as though the user is at fault? Is it worded in a helpful way so that the user understands what to do? Is it in close proximity to where the error occurred?</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="ch04_h2_009" class="head-a"><span id="page-72" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 72. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>Summary</h2>
<p class="text-fo">Ideas are born out of insights, which start by gathering and analysing data. There are many different data sources that will each give you a different piece of the puzzle.</p>
<p class="text">Start by understanding what is happening on your web and mobile site. How are visitors interacting with it? Where do they come from, where do they land, what do they do &#x2013; and what do they not do?</p>
<p class="text">Analytics data are a rich source of insights. Use funnel visualization and journey maps to find out where visitors are leaking out of your funnel. There are many other signals in analytics data to point out potential opportunities, such as bounce rate, exit rate, page value and conversion rate. Use conversion rate to compare different segments. In isolation, it&#x2019;s a meaningless metric that causes managers to obsess over the wrong thing.</p>
<p class="text">You can learn a lot by seeing how visitors interact with your site. Heat- and scrollmaps show you exactly where on a page users click and pay more attention, which is not visible in analytics data. Session replay tools make video recordings of all user interactions, including mouse and finger movements, clicks and taps. Watching these video clips can reveal behavioural patterns, usability issues and even bugs.</p>
<p class="text">Usability testing is the process of observing users interacting with your site or app. It is arguably the best method for uncovering usability issues and roadblocks in the path to conversion. The easiest approach is to use an online service. Filter their vast panel, give panellists a script to tell them what to do on your site and come back later to watch the video recordings.</p>
<p class="text">Try to combine that with moderated usability testing, where you are physically present during the session. This can even be done with people recruited live from your site. The advantage is that you watch an actual user doing what they normally would do, rather than following a script. This is a good way to discover issues that you&#x2019;re not aware of yet.</p>
<p class="text">The tools and methodologies covered in this chapter will give you a good insight into behavioural patterns. The next chapter will help you understand what&#x2019;s driving that behaviour. Armed with that knowledge, you can shape this behaviour.</p>
