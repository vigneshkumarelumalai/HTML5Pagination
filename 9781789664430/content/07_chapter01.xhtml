<p class="text-fo">This book is about growing your e-commerce business.</p>
<p class="text">You won&#x2019;t find a list of tactics ready to copy and paste. What worked for others in the past may not work for you today.</p>
<p class="text">What you need more than another menu of conversion tactics is a strategy relevant to you &#x2013; and guaranteed to grow your business.</p>
<p class="text">That&#x2019;s the purpose of this book. A step-by-step guide to a proven approach used all over the world. One not based on the latest fads, but on time-tested scientific principles.</p>
<p class="text">CRO (conversion rate optimization) is only part of it. We find CRO, as it has come to be practised, too shallow. It may surprise you to hear this from the authors, who run a leading CRO agency. However, we haven&#x2019;t allowed ourselves to be constrained by those shackles.</p>
<p class="text">By definition, CRO is focused on improving online conversion rates: turn more website visitors into paying customers. That&#x2019;s important and you will find ways to do just that in this book. But obsessing over conversion rate at the expense of other metrics can be detrimental to your business.</p>
<p class="text">To illustrate that, Scenario A in <a href="#ch01_tab_001">Table 1.1</a> has double the conversion rate of Scenario B. Which of the two scenarios would you prefer? Hint: you can&#x2019;t bank conversion rate. You can&#x2019;t use it to pay salaries or rent. </p>

<h2 id="ch01_h2_001" class="head-a">E-commerce website optimization</h2>
<p class="text-fo">To be clear, we don&#x2019;t dismiss CRO outright. On the contrary, you could argue that the framework in this book is simply a broader interpretation of CRO. Semantic nuances aside, below are some key pillars of e-commerce website optimization.</p>
<section aria-labelledby="ch01_h3_001">
<h3 id="ch01_h3_001" class="head-b">Customer profitability</h3>
<blockquote><p class="block-equation">Profit = Revenue less Cost</p>
</blockquote><p class="text-fo">That accounting view of profit doesn&#x2019;t do a great job of explaining where profit comes from. It&#x2019;s high level and backward-looking, which means it&#x2019;s not actionable.</p>
<p class="text">Let&#x2019;s break it down through a different lens. Revenue comes from individual customers. No customers, no revenue.</p>
<blockquote><p class="block-equation">&#x2002;&#x2002;&#x2002;&#x2002;&#x2002;&#x2002;&#x2002;Customers</p>
<p class="block-equation">&#x2002;&#x2002;&#x2002;&#x2002;&#x2002;&#x2002;&#x2002;&#x2002;&#x2002;&#x2002;&#x2002;&#x00D7;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p class="block-equation">Average order value (AOV)</p>
<p class="block-equation">&#x2002;&#x2002;&#x2002;&#x2002;&#x2002;&#x2002;&#x2002;&#x2002;&#x2002;&#x2002;&#x2002;&#x00D7;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p class="block-equation">&#x2002;&#x2002;Number of transactions</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p class="block-equation">&#x2002;&#x2002;&#x2002;&#x2002;&#x2002;&#x2002;&#x2002;&#x2002;&#x2002;&#x2002;&#x2002;=</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p class="block-equation">&#x2002;&#x2002;&#x2002;&#x2002;&#x2002;&#x2002;&#x2002;Revenue</p>
</blockquote><p class="text-fo">To arrive at profit, we have to bring costs into the equation. A large portion of your cost base can be attributed directly to customers.</p>
<p class="text">The cost of acquiring a new customer, for example, is often expressed as CAC (see the box &#x2018;Customer profitability metrics&#x2019;). It&#x2019;s a fact that many e-commerce businesses do not break even on that first transaction.</p>
<p class="text">There are also costs associated with retaining and serving customers. The net effect is that some customers &#x2013; the frequent purchasers and/or big spenders &#x2013; are profitable. On the other side of the spectrum, some customers frankly deserve to be fired. They cost more to have around as customers than the revenue they contribute.</p>

<aside id="ch01_aside_001" class="box" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="ch01_boxtitle_001"><h4 id="ch01_boxtitle_001" class="title" epub:type="title"><span id="page-3" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 3. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>Customer profitability metrics</h4>
<p class="text-fo">These two popular e-commerce metrics are usually applied to a segment, cohort or channel. Making comparisons between them is more insightful than knowing the respective individual values.</p>
<h5 class="head-a">Customer acquisition cost (CAC)</h5>
<p class="text-fo">Bad joke alert: Where&#x2019;s the best place to hide a dead body? Page two of Google search results.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" role="doc-noteref" href="#ch01_en1" id="ch01_enx1">1</a></sup></p>
<p class="text">Making it to the first page of search results can be tough. You&#x2019;re at the mercy of a secret and ever-changing algorithm. Paying your way to the top involves bidding against competitors, perpetuating the upward cost spiral.</p>
<p class="text">CAC is a measure of the average cost to acquire one new customer. Start with a sum of all the costs associated with gaining new customers in a year, or any other period. Include marketing and advertising expenses, but also relevant personnel and tools costs. To calculate CAC, divide this value by the number of new customers acquired over that same period.</p>
<h5 class="head-a">Lifetime value (LTV)</h5>
<p class="text-fo">Also known as customer lifetime value (CLV), this is a measure of how much a customer is worth to you over time.</p>
<p class="text">One method is to discount future cash flows attributable to a customer (or segment) to net present value (NPV), using an appropriate discount factor.</p>
<p class="text">An easier alternative is to calculate the total gross profit of all transactions for a given customer (or segment) over a certain period, typically one year.</p>
<h5 class="head-a">CAC &#x003C; LTV</h5>
<p class="text-fo">LTV gives you the upper limit of what you can spend to acquire a new customer.</p></aside>

</section>
<section aria-labelledby="ch01_h3_002">
<h3 id="ch01_h3_002" class="head-b">Growth triangle</h3>
<p class="text-fo">The view of profit set out above helps to identify high-impact growth levers. You can grow your business in three ways:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet">Increase the number of people who buy from you.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet"><span id="page-4" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 4. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>Get them to spend more when they buy.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Persuade them to come back and buy from you again.</p></li>
</ul><p class="text-fo">By definition, CRO pulls the first lever. It makes better sense to spread your efforts. Squeezing growth out of just one area is hard work. Attack all three areas, and all you need is a 26 per cent increase in each to deliver 100 per cent overall return (not 33.3 per cent because of the compound effect). That sounds infinitely more attainable than pursuing 2&#x00D7; growth in one single domain.</p>
</section>
<section aria-labelledby="ch01_h3_003">
<h3 id="ch01_h3_003" class="head-b">Optimize the sales conversation</h3>
<p class="text-fo">CRO has been reduced to UI (user interface) tweaks and implementing &#x2018;best practice&#x2019; conversion gimmicks. That doesn&#x2019;t address what is, in our view, the real opportunity.</p>
<p class="text">When a potential customer is on your site, think of it as a sales conversation happening with your business. Your site acts like a shop assistant in a physical store. Customers have questions, either about the product itself or about some other aspect such as fulfilment. They have concerns about things like delivery, price and trust.</p>
<p class="text">How likely you are to close that deal depends on how well your site answers those questions and concerns. It depends on whether your site is able to persuade the customer to do business with you, as opposed to Amazon or a competitor.</p>
<p class="text">You can only do that if you know what&#x2019;s going on inside the mind of your customers. You are not your customer; don&#x2019;t make assumptions on their behalf. In <a href="09_chapter03.xhtml#ch03_sec_001">Chapters 3</a>, <a href="10_chapter04.xhtml#ch04_sec_001">4</a> and <a href="11_chapter05.xhtml#ch05_sec_001">5</a> we show you the techniques for learning more about your customers than you thought possible. <a href="19_chapter13.xhtml#ch13_sec_001">Chapter 13</a> is devoted to understanding the sales conversation, so that you can make it more effective.</p>
</section><section aria-labelledby="ch01_h3_004">
<h3 id="ch01_h3_004" class="head-b">Test and learn</h3>
<p class="text-fo">When you look at the health of your business in a year from now, you see the effect of each decision made between now and then. Make more profitable decisions than bad ones, and your bottom line will reflect that. That&#x2019;s why you need evidence informing your decisions, instead of hunches.</p>
<p class="text">Yet, despite the prevalence of big data, <i>Harvard Business Review</i> concluded that &#x2018;most managers must operate in a world where they lack sufficient data to inform their decisions&#x2019;.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" role="doc-noteref" href="#ch01_en2" id="ch01_enx2">2</a></sup> To establish whether an idea will be <span id="page-5" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 5. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>successful, test it on actual visitors in real time. This is called experimentation (see the box &#x2018;Optimization vs experimentation&#x2019;).</p>
<p class="text">Experimentation is like having insurance against decisions that can hurt your sales. Actually it&#x2019;s better than insurance, because you remove the risk rather than merely compensate for it. With experimentation, you keep only the winners.</p>
<p class="text">As part of the process, you also identify those ideas that didn&#x2019;t go the way you expected &#x2013; the negative ones that would have become permanent features had you not tested them. Not only do you save yourself from them, you also learn from them. This gives you insight into customer preferences and behaviour that you can build on.</p>
<aside id="ch01_aside_002" class="box" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="ch01_boxtitle_002"><h4 id="ch01_boxtitle_002" class="title" epub:type="title">Optimization vs experimentation</h4>
<p class="text-fo">In this book, we talk a lot about the concepts optimization and experimentation.</p>
<p class="text"><b>Optimization</b> refers to the concept of weighing up alternative approaches in order to select the best one. For example, you could compare two variations of a mobile basket page. The final decision is based on performance against a key metric, such as conversion rate or revenue.</p>
<p class="text"><b>Experimentation</b> is a mechanism by which a variation is compared against the original. The most common type in e-commerce optimization is an A/B test, also called a split test, where half the audience see the original and the rest see the variation. This all happens without the knowledge of visitors in the test, so they are not primed to behave in a certain way.</p>
<p class="text">Experimentation is covered in detail in <a href="15_chapter09.xhtml#ch09_sec_001">Chapter 9</a>.</p></aside>
</section>
<section aria-labelledby="ch01_h3_005">
<h3 id="ch01_h3_005" class="head-b">The scientific method</h3>
<p class="text-fo">For centuries, scientists have used experimentation to find answers to questions of importance. The scientific method has helped scientists in fields as diverse as social sciences, geology and chemistry come up with new ways of understanding the world, and ultimately improving aspects of our life.</p>
<p class="text">It&#x2019;s an empirical approach, so decisions are based on evidence rather than gut feel. It relies on the ability to validate hypotheses,<sup><a href="#ch01_en3" id="ch01_enx3">3</a></sup> as illustrated in <a id="rch01_fig_001" href="#ch01_fig_001">Figure 1.1</a>.</p>

<summary>Figure 1.1 details</summary>
<p class="figure-alt-long">The steps in the diagram are: define the question, gather data, formulate hypothesis, and publish results. The process involved in formulating the hypothesis are: form a hypothesis, devise an experiment to test the hypothesis, analyse the result and interpret the result and its implication for redefining the hypothesis.</p>
</details>
</figure>
<section>
<h4 class="head-c"><span id="page-6" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 6. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>Step 1: Define the question</h4>
<p class="text-fo">&#x2018;A problem well stated is half solved&#x2019;, said the head of research at General Motors, serial inventor Charles Kettering.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" role="doc-noteref" href="#ch01_en5" id="ch01_enx5">5</a></sup></p>
<p class="text">To come up with potential solutions to business problems, first understand the scope, impact and context of the problem. Building on that, we can formulate specific questions that can be answered with data. This is referred to as problem framing.</p>
<p class="text">In e-commerce website optimization, sometimes a problem will be nominated by management. Other times, you may discover problems by doing explorative research.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h4 class="head-c">Step 2: Gather data</h4>
<p class="text-fo">Once you know the questions to ask, start gathering data and digging for insights. Much of the book is devoted to this topic.</p>
<p class="text"><span id="page-7" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 7. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>Relying on guesswork, opinions and even so-called best practice is like playing the lottery. You may win a bit of money here and there, but it&#x2019;s all down to chance. By following an evidence-led approach, you remove luck from the scene and bet only on things that you know are likely to make a difference.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h4 class="head-c">Step 3: Formulate a hypothesis</h4>
<p class="text-fo">As you gather data pertaining to the business question, ideas about improvements and solutions will inevitably start forming.</p>
<p class="text">Until you&#x2019;ve actually tested an idea, you can&#x2019;t be sure that it will have the desired effect. A crucially important part of this process is being receptive to the reality that your theory is false. Companies with strong experimentation cultures, like Amazon, Facebook, <a href="https://www.booking.com/"><span class="url-hyperlink">Booking.com</span></a> and Netflix, find that most of their ideas don&#x2019;t deliver expected results. Those ideas have been generated by the brightest people from top universities. Why should you be any different?</p>
<p class="text">That&#x2019;s why each idea or proposed solution is treated as a theory until it has been validated. The hypothesis is a way of expressing an idea that makes it testable. This process is explained in detail in <a href="14_chapter08.xhtml#ch08_sec_001">Chapter 8</a>.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h4 class="head-c">Step 4: Experiment</h4>
<p class="text-fo">You may be spot-on with your idea, or totally wide of the mark. No one knows until you put it to the test by running an experiment. The results will either validate or refute your hypothesis &#x2013; but either way, you&#x2019;ll learn something about your customers, their preferences and behaviour.</p>
<p class="text">The most common form of experiment is an A/B test. Half your visitors see the current experience and half see the new variation, which incorporates changes that you predict will improve a certain metric. The test group has no idea that they are seeing something different.</p>
<p class="text">Yet behind the scenes, the technology is carefully monitoring who has seen which version, how they are behaving, and the effect on various predefined metrics. After a short period of time, you compare results to see how the variation has altered the behaviour of the test group.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h4 class="head-c">Step 5: Analyse the result</h4>
<p class="text-fo">The experiment could have one of three outcomes:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet">The variation is a &#x2018;winner&#x2019; and your hypothesis is validated.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">The variation does not &#x2018;win&#x2019; and the hypothesis is refuted.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">There is no difference between the variation and control; it is inconclusive.</p></li>
</ul><p class="text-fo"><span id="page-8" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 8. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>On face value, it looks like you should have your fingers crossed for a win all the time. Yay! Crack open the Champagne, roll out the variation and watch all those visitors start spending. Ker-ching!</p>
<p class="text">In fact, this kind of &#x2018;triumph and disaster&#x2019; thinking is counter-productive. Long-term success comes out of being truly scientific. Hoping for a positive result means you&#x2019;re emotionally invested in it, which introduces a form of bias. Whatever the outcome, make it your aim to bank the learning and move forward.</p>
<p class="text">A win can often point the way to further tests around the same hypothesis that could give you even bigger uplifts. Tests that don&#x2019;t win are also valuable. There is usually a lot you can learn from them &#x2013; insight you can use to design another variation that really rakes in the cash.</p> <p class="text">We&#x2019;ve seen many big wins born out of insights that could only have been obtained by running a test and getting a negative result.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h4 class="head-c">Step 6: Interpret the result</h4>
<p class="text-fo">The purpose of a scientific study is usually to contribute new knowledge; this is no different. Whether you have validated or rejected the hypothesis, with every concluded test you know more about your customers than you did before. Gradually, you will learn vast amounts about what works for your customers and what doesn&#x2019;t.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h4 class="head-c">Step 7: Document the result</h4>
<p class="text-fo">In the scientific community, the contribution of new knowledge is formalized by publishing the details of the experiment. Similarly, your work is not complete until you have documented your result. This includes recording the insights from each experiment to share with your colleagues in other parts of the business.</p>
<p class="text">With each experiment you collect new knowledge about your customers. Over time, this leads you to make long-term improvements in all areas of the business.</p>
<p class="text">You&#x2019;ll be able to tie all the strands together to create a roadmap for the months ahead. The detailed process of prioritizing what to work on first &#x2013; and what to ignore &#x2013; and then creating an optimization roadmap is covered in <a href="13_chapter07.xhtml#ch07_sec_001">Chapter 7</a>.</p>
<p class="text">The rest of this book tells you exactly how to implement those seven steps into your own organization, with practical examples, step-by-step instructions and case studies.</p>

<h2 id="ch01_h2_002" class="head-a"><span id="page-9" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 9. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>Summary</h2>
<p class="text-fo">This book walks you through a proven system to help you to grow your e-commerce business. You can do that in one of three ways:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet">Increase the number of people who buy from you.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Get them to spend more when they buy.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Persuade them to come back and buy from you again.</p></li>
</ul><p class="text-fo">The system in this book is rooted in the scientific method, which has been used for years by scientists to find answers to important questions. In e-commerce website optimization, those are business questions related to the three growth pillars listed above.</p>
<p class="text">You start with research to form a vivid picture about where the biggest opportunities for growth are. There will be no shortage of ideas about how to unlock the potential.</p>
<p class="text">Until those ideas have been validated, they are theories. In a scientific experiment, the theories are then tested in real time on the visitors to your website, mobile app and other channels.</p>
<p class="text">Some ideas may not give you the results you expected. This happens when the new variation performs worse than the original. This is not a failure! You have been able to catch and prevent an idea from going into production and hurting sales. More importantly, a negative test gives you unique insights that could not have been obtained in any other way. Often, that is the start of the next big winner.</p>
<p class="text">Finally, the scientific method, since it aims to generate new knowledge, is continuous. If the world were to stop turning and things remained as they are, then perhaps optimization would be a one-off project. We all know that everything is changing all the time. Buckle up and enjoy the ride!</p>
