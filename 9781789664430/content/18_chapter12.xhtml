<h3 id="ch12_h3_001" class="head-b">Skills and traits of talented optimizers</h3>
<p class="text-fo">A key skill these people have is the ability to switch comfortably between left- and right-brain thinking (<a id="rch12_fig_001" href="#ch12_fig_001">Figure 12.1</a>).</p>

</figcaption>
<p class="figure-media"><img src="images/M12NF001.jpg" alt="An illustration of the human brain shows the skill sets of optimizers. The thinking of left brain shows logic, verbal, rational and so on, while the thinking of right brain shows art, music, emotions and so on."/></p>
</figure>
<section>
<h4 class="head-c">Left-brain thinking</h4>
<p class="text-fo">Left-brain thinking is concerned with logic, rationality and working with numbers. Analytical skills are a huge part of what an optimizer needs to have in their toolkit. For a recent client, one of our optimizers:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet">analysed 20 million Google Analytics and IBM Digital Analytics sessions;</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">observed website visitors for 20&#x002B; hours during usability testing;</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">examined the click pattern from 175,000 sessions using heatmaps, scroll maps, confetti maps and others;</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">read and analysed 20,000 survey responses;</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">performed 443 navigation tasks using specialized tools;</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">read numerous live chat transcripts;</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">conducted five store visits, interviewing store managers and shop floor staff;</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">interviewed the customer service team and the live chat operators.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="text-fo"><span id="page-204" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 204. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>To cope with this amount of data, an optimizer needs advanced information processing and number-crunching skills. The process of prioritizing large numbers of possible website improvements to create an optimization plan requires focus and independent thought. To accurately interpret a completed test, the optimizer needs both analytics skills and a thorough grounding in statistics.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h4 class="head-c">Right-brain thinking</h4>
<p class="text-fo">Contrast this attention to detail with the thought processes dominant in right-brain thinking.</p>
<p class="text">First is the ability to build relationships with the broader internal team (developers, copywriters, managers, co-workers, business leaders, etc). They also need to be able to quickly establish rapport and show empathy with people when using research methods like moderated usability testing. This should be allied with creative skills; coming up with imaginative but relevant solutions to the identified opportunities. It&#x2019;s one thing to identify a conversion killer, but it takes a leap of imagination to understand how to translate this problem into a new, improved version:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet">What will the wireframe look like?</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">What copy is required?</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">How will someone navigate this new page?</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="text-fo">These are examples of creative questions the optimizer will deal with. Understanding the fundamentals of consumer psychology, covered in <a href="19_chapter13.xhtml#ch13_sec_001">Chapter 13</a>, plays an important part here.</p>
<p class="text">Presenting the results of research and tests also requires creativity; to put oneself in the position of your audience and tailor the presentation to their needs. Here the focus is on condensing vast amounts of research into a few powerful ideas that have been tested scientifically, and then presenting the results in non-technical language that illuminates the insight gained.</p>
<p class="text">To bring left- and right-brain thinking together, an effective optimizer has to be obsessed with detail and familiar with the minutiae of the visitor experience, while at the same time holding onto the bigger picture. They understand that buying online is a complex process involving your offer and how it&#x2019;s positioned in the market, user experience, persuasion techniques and a number of psychological factors.</p>
<p class="text">Other traits include a passion for website optimization, zealot-like determination to be continually improving and a drive to translate optimization into hard cash for the business. Overwhelmingly, talented optimizers are both curious and humble; they know what they don&#x2019;t know and are always looking to learn more.</p>
</section>

<section aria-labelledby="ch12_h3_002">
<h3 id="ch12_h3_002" class="head-b">Being an attractive employer</h3>
<p class="text-fo">The competition for optimizers is intense, so think about this question, which your ideal candidate will be asking him or herself: &#x2018;Given the competition for my talents, why would I join your company?&#x2019;</p>
<p class="text">If this sounds similar to the principles of creating a strong value proposition that we discussed in <a href="11_chapter05.xhtml#ch05_sec_001">Chapter 5</a>, then you&#x2019;re right. The technique works just as well for recruiting your team as it does for recruiting customers.</p>
<p class="text">Find out what optimizers are looking for in an employer. Reach out to communities in relevant LinkedIn groups and the blogosphere. Study how other companies looking for the same sort of person are defining their value proposition. Is yours clear and compelling?</p>
<p class="text">Ask your existing team why they enjoy working for your business, and use that in your job ad. Being specific when communicating your value proposition adds credibility. For example, instead of &#x2018;We are committed to your professional development&#x2019;, consider: &#x2018;Last year each member of our team received on average 112 hours of training, that&#x2019;s nearly 4 weeks of solid investment in you &#x2013; we are committed to your development.&#x2019;</p>
<section>
<h4 class="head-c">Remote working</h4>
<p class="text-fo"><span id="page-205" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 205. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>Chances are that your ideal optimizer is not living nearby. They may be located in a different country, a different time zone even. If you want to employ the best, consider the adaptations you might need to make &#x2013; technology, team and processes &#x2013; to allow a remote worker to be an effective team player. If your setup supports this way of working, better to get the most talented optimizer to work for you and make the necessary adjustments than to choose someone on the basis of their proximity.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h4 class="head-c">Finding the right person</h4>
<p class="text-fo">Simply advertising the role might not attract enough experienced individuals. Another option is to approach people directly. Website optimization covers many disciplines and talented optimizers are always soaking up new knowledge and sharing what they have learnt, so look out for people who are active in public forums, commenting and sharing their knowledge.</p>
<ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet"><span id="page-206" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 206. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>Many conversion agencies publish blogs with an active comments section &#x2013; eg ConversionXL, Widerfunnel, Unbounce, Conversion Sciences, Occam&#x2019;s Razor, Get Elastic and Marketing Experiments. Testing platform providers &#x2013; Qubit, Maxymiser, Monetate, Optimizely, Convert, VWO and Adobe &#x2013; provide similar forums.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">LinkedIn groups for CRO and website optimization.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Slack channel on CRO/website optimization.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="text-fo">Before approaching candidates, create a survey for interested individuals to complete as part of the selection process. Questions could include:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet">Please provide 2&#x2013;3 examples of how you have created impressive results for online businesses.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Tell us about your experience of:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet-sub">
<li><p class="list-bullet-sub">direct response marketing and copywriting;</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet-sub">designing/wireframing high-converting webpages.</p></li></ul></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Tell us about the level of experience (extensive, some or none) you have with the tools used in our organization: eg analytics packages, testing platforms, voice-of-customer tools, statistics, JavaScript and facilitation of usability sessions.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="text-fo">To form a richer picture about a candidate, we set up a voicemail account and ask candidates to phone in after they have completed the survey. For us, this part of the process is as important as their responses to the survey. On the voicemail the prospective candidates are asked a number of questions:</p>
<ol class="list-number"><li><p class="list-number">Why are you applying for this role?</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number">What has been your greatest achievement to date?</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number">Tell us about a time when you overcame a difficulty; what was it and how did you overcome it?</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="text-fo">Listening to a candidate&#x2019;s tone of voice, and how they handle these questions with little time to prepare, will tell you a lot about them.</p>
<p class="text">Having defined your value proposition, and set up your survey and voicemail account, you can now start approaching possible candidates. Create a shortlist of those who responded to your contact, completed your survey and left you a voicemail. The next stage is to hold individual interviews and talk through the answers they gave in their survey response.</p>
<p class="text">Focus particularly on the metrics that applicants are using to explain the results they have created &#x2013; is this site-wide revenue uplift, or is it just progression to the next step in the customer journey, reducing bounce rate on a landing page or increasing <span id="page-207" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 207. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>e-mail sign-up rates? We have had some experience of applicants exaggerating the significance of the results they have created.</p>
<p class="text">If relevant, explore how a remote working environment could fit in with your business. What experience do they have of building relationships remotely? What challenges do they face working remotely? Could they come and spend a week in the office, at least initially?</p>
<p class="text">Try to discover what effort they make to stay up to date; what was the last new tool or research technique they used? Do they have a clear sense of what they don&#x2019;t know, and what plans have they got to address this?</p>
<p class="text">If you feel confident about their track record, how they would work with you and their commitment to keeping at the top of their game, the next stage is a practical test. We ask candidates to review a particular web page. Along with it we provide some basic data. We ask them to come up with a wireframe, explain their thinking and the data on which they have based these recommendations.</p>
<p class="text">You can develop your own criteria for evaluating applications, but we pay particular attention to:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet">Demonstration of analytical thinking</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">The logic of their arguments</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Ability to communicate clearly</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="text-fo">Then hold a group interview with individuals who make the practical test stage. We have done this successfully on Google Hangouts, with four interviewers and a similar number of candidates. It can be telling to see how candidates react to a competitive selection process.</p>

<h3 id="ch12_h3_003" class="head-b">How to keep your in-house optimizer motivated</h3>
<p class="text-fo">For a single in-house optimizer, the job could be lonely and isolating, with no one to bat around ideas and refine hypotheses. At the same time, talented optimizers value autonomy. Motivation and retention require you to manage their need for community and independence simultaneously. They also have an insatiable thirst for knowledge, and knowing what they are doing is making a difference to the bottom line. To keep them motivated, ensure there are processes in place that allow them to:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet">spend time acquiring knowledge and being part of the conversion community;</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet"><span id="page-208" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 208. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>go on training courses, subscribe to paid-for courses and attend events;</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">present your company&#x2019;s results at conferences and spark debate and interaction with their peers;</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">work flexibly &#x2013; from home, from remote locations and from the office when the need is there;</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">allocate a proportion of their time to work on their own project, as companies like 3M and Google do.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="text-fo">Having spoken to many optimizers, as well as those who recruit for these roles, one of the most common criticisms of employers is that firms do not fully understand what optimization is and what it can do for the business. Consequently, optimizers are directed to work on parts of the site where there is little evidence of it being a real opportunity. Or there is a lack of support for testing controversial areas where an opportunity has been identified. Before hiring an optimizer, you and your management should agree on the scope of the role.</p>

<h2 id="ch12_h2_002" class="head-a">Obstacles to a culture of optimization</h2>
<p class="text-fo">Finding and motivating a talented optimizer is one factor in the success of your programme; another is to build and reinforce a culture of optimization. Some of the benefits of having a culture of optimization:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet">You grow your business more quickly.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">You spend less time in endless internal debates.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">You learn continuously.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">You get focused on what really matters.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Your developers only work on ideas that have been validated.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="text-fo"><span id="page-209" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 209. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>A number of obstacles can prevent your organization from becoming data driven and having an optimization mindset, which should be tackled first.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" role="doc-noteref" href="#ch12_en1" id="ch12_enx1">1</a></sup> In this section we&#x2019;ll examine cognitive biases that can impact the individual, particularly your optimizer, as well the obstacles your organization might face in terms of embedding an optimization culture.</p>
<section aria-labelledby="ch12_h3_004">
<h3 id="ch12_h3_004" class="head-b">Obstacles faced by individuals</h3>
<p class="text-fo">When we are making judgements and decisions about the world around us, we like to think that we are objective and logical. Unfortunately, the reality is that our judgements and decisions are often impaired by errors and influenced by a wide variety of biases. These are called cognitive biases, and can have a detrimental impact on an optimization process reliant on making judgements on huge quantities of data. By being aware of them, you have a better chance of reducing their impact. Here are 11 biases we believe are most relevant to website optimization:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet"><b>Belief bias</b> &#x2013; We often accept invalid data to support a judgement based on our own beliefs. Believing something to be the case doesn&#x2019;t make it true. As much as possible, be aware of the role of your own beliefs in reaching a decision.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet"><b>Certainty bias</b> &#x2013; In a perfectly rational world, we would value equally a change of probability going from 0 per cent to 10 per cent as we would from, say, 45 per cent to 55 per cent. In fact we don&#x2019;t; we value certainty differently, depending on the starting point. This often results in us being more risk averse as we experience more disquiet as certainty diminishes, even if the less probable situation could benefit us more.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet"><b>Confirmation bias</b> &#x2013; Sometimes one theory, or hypothesis, dominates our thoughts so strongly that it becomes a preconception, so much so that we don&#x2019;t even realize there are alternatives &#x2013; or even look for them. This means we could easily overlook data or conclusions that fly in the face of this preconception.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet"><b>Congruence bias</b> &#x2013; Though similar to confirmation bias, congruence bias is concerned with the risk in optimization that we only split test one possible hypothesis, when in fact there are other possible hypotheses that may have been more valid and worthy of testing.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet"><b>Dunning&#x2013;Kruger bias</b> &#x2013; This is where people who are &#x2018;incompetent&#x2019; are more likely to be confident in their actions because they don&#x2019;t know what they don&#x2019;t know. When recruiting for an optimizer, ask them about areas where they feel less competent and be cautious of people who claim expertise in every area.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet"><b>Framing bias</b> &#x2013; We will often react to choice based on whether the outcome has been presented or &#x2018;framed&#x2019; as a loss or a gain. Even small changes to how these outcomes are framed can have a profound impact on the choices we make and the risk we will tolerate.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet"><b><span id="page-210" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 210. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>Fundamental attribution error (FAE)</b> &#x2013; This is where we give undue importance to people&#x2019;s character and intention, rather than unconnected external factors. For example, if your checkout is causing users frustration, some might blame their &#x2018;stupidity&#x2019; rather than accept how difficult the site is to use.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet"><b>Hindsight bias</b> &#x2013; Sometimes called the &#x2018;knew it all along&#x2019; effect, this is the tendency to see an event, after it has occurred, as predictable. This bias can often be seen in the analysis of medical experiments, judicial systems and historians writing about past events. For website optimization, this might mean that positive tests are less carefully scrutinized than negative tests, because the result, in &#x2018;hindsight&#x2019;, was predictable and therefore less worthy of analysis and challenge.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet"><b>Information bias</b> &#x2013; Sometimes we continue to collect more and more information on the basis that more is better, and the additional data will lead to a more informed decision. When you are investing more time in collecting larger data sets, be clear as to exactly what question you are trying to answer and whether these new data will help you achieve this.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet"><b>Narrative fallacy</b> &#x2013; A common tendency many of us have is to try to explain why something has occurred; we seek to provide a &#x2018;logical&#x2019; link between two facts. Explanations bind facts together, and yet this explanation may be incorrect. For example, in the case of a split test, the only datum that is known is the split-test result; providing a narrative is just conjecture.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet"><b>Self-serving bias</b> &#x2013; This tendency arises out of a need to bolster our self-esteem by claiming &#x2018;success&#x2019; to be down to our own qualities or traits, With &#x2018;failure&#x2019; we are more likely to blame this on external factors. To work effectively in website optimization, divorce yourself from your need for self-esteem and avoid being emotionally invested in the results of your split tests.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="text-fo">Whenever we are presented with information, we are prone to cognitive bias &#x2013; and more than one at a time. Think about how you can counter these biases. Remember data are neutral, but it is the way we process information that can have a significant impact on the validity of our decisions.</p>

<section aria-labelledby="ch12_h3_005">
<h3 id="ch12_h3_005" class="head-b">Obstacles faced by organizations</h3>
<p class="text-fo">Three of the most powerful obstacles you may face in embedding a culture of optimization in your organization include:</p>
<ol class="list-number"><li><p class="list-number"><span id="page-211" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 211. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>the impact of a top-down organizational hierarchy;</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number">internal competition;</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number">lack of understanding about data and statistics and reliance on gut instinct.</p></li>
</ol>
<section>
<h4 class="head-c">Top-down organizational hierarchies</h4>
<p class="text-fo">As senior managers climb the organizational hierarchy, they tend to spend more time managing those with direct contact with the customer, and less time with customers themselves. While power rests with the manager, insight about the customer&#x2019;s needs and motivations are further down the organization. Rigid organizational hierarchies, where there is little sharing of knowledge between those leading the business and those interacting with customers, represents an obstacle to optimization. Decisions about the way to treat customers can be disconnected from what customers need. We have seen e-commerce teams &#x2018;hide&#x2019; controversial tests from the rest of the organization in case senior managers, unfamiliar with the reasons behind the test, choose to stop the test prematurely.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h4 class="head-c">Internal competition</h4>
<p class="text-fo">Competition can arise between departments when objectives, measures and incentives do not align. This lack of alignment can turn friends into foes as well as undermine efforts to collaborate.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" role="doc-noteref" href="#ch12_en2" id="ch12_enx2">2</a></sup> Often this lack of cooperation goes hand in hand with departments not sharing valuable information with others. As an agency we have seen many departmental battles over what should appear on the homepage, each department determined to fight for their right for equal prominence. We have also seen store managers reluctant to direct in-store customers to the website as this online purchase wouldn&#x2019;t be reflected in store sales.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h4 class="head-c">Lack of understanding about data and statistics</h4>
<p class="text-fo">As more organizations aspire to be &#x2018;data driven&#x2019; and the volume of available data increases exponentially, research indicates that managers&#x2019; data literacy has not kept pace.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" role="doc-noteref" href="#ch12_en3" id="ch12_enx3">3</a></sup> Even when they believe they are making decisions based on data, the interpretation is flawed. When reviewing new clients&#x2019; previous test results, we often find that wins have been declared prematurely. In some cases, a senior manager had intervened and stopped the test, based on his or her opinion that the test had produced a &#x2018;good result&#x2019;.</p>
</section>

<section aria-labelledby="ch12_h3_006">
<h3 id="ch12_h3_006" class="head-b"><span id="page-212" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 212. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>Successful optimization cultures</h3>
<p class="text-fo">Successful optimization cultures share seven things in common:<sup><a href="#ch12_en4" id="ch12_enx4">4</a></sup></p>
<ol class="list-number"><li><p class="list-number"><b>Sharing culture &#x2013; are shared, and shared widely,</b> rather than being &#x2018;owned&#x2019; by departments. Without a commitment to data-sharing practices, data hoarding results, a richer picture fails to be grasped and opportunities are missed.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number"><b>Broad data literacy</b> &#x2013; In order for a data-informed culture to flourish, senior managers need training to understand the nuances, terminology and inferences of statistical analysis. There are courses available on Coursera, Udacity, Khan Academy and others.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number"><b>Goals-first culture</b> &#x2013; Optimization is for a purpose, an overarching mission. A strategic vision allows the optimization process to work towards this goal.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number"><b>Inquisitive, questioning culture</b> &#x2013; Frank and open discussion about the data, rather than the personalities or layers of hierarchies involved, allows a far more scientific evaluation of the experiments and the results. This experimentation mindset can help to eliminate the egos often present in organizational improvement projects.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number"><b>Iterative, learning culture</b> &#x2013; Using the language of &#x2018;learning&#x2019; rather than &#x2018;failure&#x2019; or &#x2018;success&#x2019; allows you to focus on what you can learn from each experiment, and to continue the process of iterating and optimizing.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number"><b>Anti-HIPPO culture</b> &#x2013; Senior managers who continue to adopt a decision-making style that is based on their experience, preconceived notions and their gut, without regard to the available data, will undermine successful data-informed cultures.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number"><b>Data leadership</b> &#x2013; Successful businesses &#x2018;compete on analytics&#x2019; and leaders set an example in their use and promotion of data-informed decision making. This means providing the tools and training, but most importantly, recruiting other senior managers through celebrating wins &#x2013; however small they may appear at first.</p></li></ol>

To promote competitions between the &#x2018;DJs&#x2019;, a &#x2018;chart&#x2019; was published showing the best-performing split test. Stakeholders from outside the team were &#x2018;given&#x2019; tests as their own, with access to the testing platform so they could easily monitor their performance. Senior managers, from outside the digital and analytics team, were able to grasp the importance of a testing culture to the bank &#x2013; and get the chance to briefly join the troop of Superstar DJs.</p>
<p class="text">&#x2018;The way you are bringing this to life is nothing short of brilliant&#x2019;, one senior manager commented.</p>
<p class="text">Embedding an optimization culture is about recognizing the obstacles that affect the individual, such as cognitive biases, as well as the organization &#x2013; the negative impact of hierarchies, internal competition and lack of understanding about data. This case study shows how such an optimization culture can be both exciting and creative.</p>

<h2 id="ch12_h2_003" class="head-a">When to outsource</h2>
<p class="text-fo">Sometimes it is not possible to recruit an in-house optimizer because of obstacles such as headcount budget, inflexibility about remote working or inability to find the right candidate. An external resource or agency can help in a number of different ways:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet">You are growing rapidly, website traffic is growing quickly and you realize you have the financial resources but not the time to invest in optimization. A third party can start working alongside you to turn this burgeoning traffic into correspondingly higher online sales. Also, high-growth companies are often focused on growth and may overlook some conversion issues that no one else has had time to address.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet"><span id="page-214" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 214. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>Your digital team is young and, although enthusiastic, is inexperienced with website optimization. This might be the time to consider an agency that will help you get off to a flying start, and over time transfer knowledge to your team as they see how the agency does what it does. Make sure the agency you choose has experience of knowledge transfer and is able to provide mentoring or coaching services as your need for direct assistance starts to taper. Doing the work well is not the same as teaching and mentoring others to do it equally well.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">You might have been optimizing your website for quite some time, and starting to see your results plateau. This is the time to engage an agency that can provide a fresh perspective and develop a completely new roadmap, so have a number of new sets of optimization opportunities on which your in-house team can focus.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">You may be expanding into new, international territories, where the culture is different and the needs of these website visitors and customers will not match those from your domestic market. Many companies have simply localized their current website into an international version, without fully understanding the differences between cultures and approaches to online buying. Agencies with international optimization experience would be a good use of resources in leveraging the investment you are making in these new markets.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Likewise, if you are creating a new customer journey, as in creating a new range of products or services, then it makes sense to bring in an agency to do the research as to how a new set of visitors might respond to your new merchandise or services.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Finally, if you are based in a rural location, it is going to be challenging to find sufficiently experienced talent on your doorstep. In this case, bringing in an agency on a monthly retainer basis is the best opportunity for getting an optimization programme in place.</p></li>

<section aria-labelledby="ch12_h2_004">
<h2 id="ch12_h2_004" class="head-a">Summary</h2>
<p class="text-fo">Talented optimizers are skilled at using both left-brain (analytical and data-driven) and right-brain (creative and empathetic) thinking styles. They are marked out with traits such as humility, curiosity, persuasiveness, being process oriented and detail obsessed. As people, they are determined, passionate and have a <span id="page-215" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 215. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>thorough grounding in consumer psychology and web technologies. The competition for their talent is, unsurprisingly, intense.</p>
<p class="text">To compete for this talent, focus your attention on what makes you stand out as an employer. Use online forums to discover what it takes to be an employer for which optimizers want to work. Compare the proposition offered by other companies looking for this resource and be specific as to why you would be an ideal fit. Use a structured selection process to evaluate the claims made by your candidates, as well as offer the chance to show how they would optimize a real site.</p>
<p class="text">Being data driven and embedding a culture of optimization poses challenges for both individuals and organizations. Cognitive biases can sway an individual&#x2019;s understanding of what the data really are communicating. Organizations are often faced with issues around top-down hierarchies, internal competition and a lack of data literacy at senior level. We proposed a seven-point model of a successful optimization culture, and showed how an international bank repositioned optimization team members as Superstar DJs.</p>
<p class="text">Finally, there may be times when it makes sense to outsource optimization to a third party. This may be because the business is in a high-growth phase, you are based in a talent-starved location, you have an inexperienced optimization team, your current results have started to plateau or you may be expanding into a new territory or building new customer journeys.</p>
