<p class="text-fo">We owe thanks to the team at Kogan Page, Lachean Humphreys and Jenny Volich. Thank you for telling us that we needed to write a second edition, and thanks for all your support.</p>
<p class="text">Nicole Major from AWA has acted as our editor, researcher, proofreader and general fixer. She has been invaluable to the process.</p>
<p class="text">This book has featured more work from respected practitioners and experts from the world of business experimentation. We would like to especially thank Professor Stefan Thomke (Harvard Business School) and Ron Kohavi (Microsoft) for sharing their research and knowledge. It has informed many of our thought processes.</p>
<p class="text-fo">Johann: Thank you Andrea, Brandt, Mickey and Silke for your patience. Working on the second edition meant spending many evenings and weekends away from home.</p>
<p class="text-fo">Dan: Thank you to my co-author, Johann. Your persistence in completing this second edition while doing a demanding day job has been inspiring.<span id="page-xvi" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page xvi. " epub:type="pagebreak"/></p>
