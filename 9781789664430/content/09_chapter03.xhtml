<p class="text-fo">The e-commerce manager at a prominent retailer was telling us about their website optimization plans. &#x2018;We know exactly what to do,&#x2019; they said confidently. Asked where that knowledge came from, they replied: &#x2018;Years of experience.&#x2019;</p>
<p class="text">Like this manager, you may feel that you know what needs to be done and that no further investigation is required. But nobody can be expected to know all the answers or, for that matter, all the questions.</p>
<p class="text">You act on knowledge available to you at the time. That means going after opportunities you know to be real, presumably using solutions you know to be valid (<i>known knowns</i>). In e-commerce website optimization, you get to this point by validating ideas with A/B testing.</p>
<p class="text">You may have ideas about how to address a particular opportunity, but until they&#x2019;ve been tested, you can&#x2019;t be certain that they are going to be effective. These are <i>known unknowns</i>.</p>
<p class="text">The e-commerce manager in the opening story above is relying on <i>unknown knowns</i> &#x2013; intuition and experience. This is risky territory, because the human brain is prone to a range of cognitive biases (see <a href="18_chapter12.xhtml#ch12_sec_001">Chapter 12</a>). Even the best teams get it wrong most of the time.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" role="doc-noteref" href="#ch03_en1" id="ch03_enx1">1</a></sup></p>
<p class="text">Finally, we don&#x2019;t know what we don&#x2019;t know. These are total blind spots &#x2013; our <i>unknown unknowns</i> &#x2013; that can be surfaced by looking at data. The biggest growth opportunities and insights may be hidden here.</p>
<p class="text">It&#x2019;s an exciting journey, full of discovery and surprise. Don&#x2019;t be put off by terms like &#x2018;analysis&#x2019; and &#x2018;research&#x2019;, which probably don&#x2019;t sell it well!</p>
<p class="text">Here is a little taste of the types of research, based on a framework outlined in <i>Just Enough Research</i>,<sup><a href="#ch03_en2" id="ch03_enx2">2</a></sup> that you&#x2019;ll be doing throughout the lifecycle of your optimization programme:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet"><b>Generative/exploratory research</b>: uncover problems and opportunities; explore the <i>unknown unknown.</i></p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet"><b>Descriptive/explanatory research</b>: targeted analysis into the <i>known unknown</i>; understand the opportunity better; also post-test analysis to explain the outcome of experimentation and document those insights.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet"><b>Evaluative research</b>: peer review and usability testing of proposed treatments and solutions.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet"><b><span id="page-25" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 25.

</ul><section><h2 id="ch03_h3_001" class="head-a">The role of previous research</h2>
<p class="text-fo">If you have previously done research, you may wonder whether another round is really necessary. The enterprise clients we work with in our agency usually have a plethora of research reports, often done at great cost.</p>
<p class="text">In our experience, research conducted for other purposes seldom offers the insights needed to power an optimization programme. It&#x2019;s not meant as criticism; objectives are different. For example, there are fundamental differences between typical marketing research and what you might need to do in optimization.</p>
<p class="text">For our purposes, research is not done for the sake of creating reports and graphs and tables. Your task is to generate <b>actionable insights</b>. That&#x2019;s what the next few chapters are about.</p>
<p class="text">Existing research can offer you a valuable foundation, though. It can aid your analysis; you can compare, confirm, extend or refute earlier findings. That is how new knowledge is generated, by layering new research on earlier studies.</p>
<p class="text">Also, social scientists accept that different researchers will generate different insights from the same data. In fact, even the same researcher looking at the same data set at another time may have different interpretations!</p>

<h2 id="ch03_h2_001" class="head-a">From data to insights</h2>
<p class="text-fo">Getting from data to meaningful insights can be intimidating.</p>
<p class="text">Many managers we speak to find all the data overwhelming. They don&#x2019;t know what to do with them so they don&#x2019;t do anything. Others waste hours trying to find something in a data rabbit hole, with no idea of what it is that they&#x2019;re looking for.</p>
<p class="text"><b>Data</b> are just raw information stored as numbers and/or text. In that state they are of little practical use. You give meaning to data through <b>analysis</b>. That simply means documenting your <b>observations</b> &#x2013; what you saw and heard. <b>Insights</b> are your interpretation of those observations in the context of other findings.</p>

<section aria-labelledby="ch03_h2_002">
<h2 id="ch03_h2_002" class="head-a">Extract insights like the CIA</h2>
<p class="text-fo">If you feel overwhelmed by data, spare a thought for intelligence analysts. Not only must they sift through tons of data, they must find information <span id="page-26" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 26. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>relevant to national security &#x2013; like preventing the next bomb attack. We could probably learn a thing or two from them.</p>
<section aria-labelledby="ch03_h3_002">
<h3 id="ch03_h3_002" class="head-b">Sensemaking</h3>
<p class="text-fo">There&#x2019;s a wonderfully descriptive term for the process of extracting meaning and insights from information &#x2013; <i>sensemaking</i>.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" role="doc-noteref" href="#ch03_en3" id="ch03_enx3">3</a></sup> The process, used by many intelligence agents, has been studied and codified. One widely cited study explained the flow from raw data into insights thus:<sup><a href="#ch03_en4" id="ch03_enx4">4</a></sup></p>
<blockquote><p class="block-quote">Data sources &#x003E; Shoebox &#x003E; Evidence file &#x003E; Schema &#x003E; Hypotheses &#x003E; Stories</p>
</blockquote><p class="text-fo">These are not steps in a linear process. Rather, it is a way of thinking about the transformation of data. Let&#x2019;s explore each of these six areas in more detail, to see how to make sense of your data.</p>
<section>
<h4 class="head-c">Data sources</h4>
<p class="text-fo">Over the next few chapters you&#x2019;ll learn about various data-gathering tools and methods used in e-commerce optimization. Each one gives you a different piece of the puzzle.</p>
<p class="text">Data can be <b>quantitative</b> or <b>qualitative</b>. In broad terms, qualitative is what people say (text or speech) and quantitative is numbers. Quantitative data tell you <i>what</i> is happening, whereas qualitative data help you understand <i>why</i> it is happening. Some data have elements of both.</p>
<p class="text">Suppose you observe an 80 per cent exit rate on your basket page. That means 8 out of 10 potential customers are leaving the site at this point in their journey. This is quantitative data telling you what is happening.</p>
<p class="text">However, you can&#x2019;t treat that problem without knowing what might be causing it. So you fire up a quick survey on that page, asking abandoning users why they are leaving. Most of the comments talk about uncertainty about the delivery time frame. Now that&#x2019;s something you can act on in solving the problem.</p>
<p class="text">Qualitative research can be a rich source of new insights into the world of your customers, their motivations, needs and pain points. The advantage of quantitative research is that you can express in numbers the observations underpinning those insights. A new dimension is added to it by counting, ordering, ranking, making comparisons and so on. It makes for a perfect marriage between qualitative and quantitative data. Use the strengths of each to shine a light on your observation from different angles. This is referred to as <b>triangulation</b> of data, and it is a cornerstone of the approach taken in this book.</p>
<p class="text"><span id="page-27" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 27. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>There is a difference between what people say (<b>attitudinal data</b>) and what they do (<b>behavioural data</b>). It&#x2019;s important to cover both perspectives in your research.</p>
<p class="text">Interviews and surveys are examples of attitudinal research. Behavioural insights are obtained by observing people. A/B testing is a good example of that because it measures changes in behaviour.</p>
<p class="text">Humans are notoriously bad at predicting their own behaviour. Steve Jobs famously said: &#x2018;A lot of times, people don&#x2019;t know what they want until you show it to them.&#x2019;<sup><a href="#ch03_en5" id="ch03_enx5">5</a></sup> But what they can tell you about is the teeth-gnashing frustration they feel when they can&#x2019;t do something quickly and easily on your site. Instead of asking users how to improve a page, ask them why they left without taking any action. Then make a change based on that feedback and see if people behave differently.</p>

<h4 class="head-c"><span id="page-28" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 28. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>Shoebox</h4>
<p class="text-fo">Your task is not to squeeze every last drop of intelligence out of every tiny bit of data. At some point, the additional gain doesn&#x2019;t justify the additional effort. You don&#x2019;t need to chain yourself to a huge pile of reports and consume every number and every word.</p>
<p class="text">When working with a big data set, start the analysis on a random sample. That initial selection of data is your proverbial shoebox.</p>
<p class="text">Suppose for example that you have collected thousands of free-text responses as part of an e-mail survey. There&#x2019;s no need to put every single response under the microscope, not just yet. Start with 200 randomly selected responses. That will give you a good overview of what this particular source has to offer. If you feel you are still getting surprised by some of the responses after processing the initial batch, process another sample. If not, move to the next data source and loop back to this one later.</p>
<p class="text">Limit your time on each data source. Make Parkinson&#x2019;s Law, &#x2018;work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion&#x2019;,<sup><a href="#ch03_en7" id="ch03_enx7">7</a></sup> work in your favour. By limiting the scope of your analysis, you can avoid analysis paralysis.</p>
<p class="text">You can come back to a data set later, by which time you&#x2019;ll have more context from having seen a wider range of data. You&#x2019;ll be better informed and have new perspectives when you loop back to it later. The journey from data to insights is non-linear. Avoid the rabbit hole, keep moving forward.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h4 class="head-c">Evidence file</h4>
<p class="text-fo">The evidence file is a collection of all your annotated observations in Google Docs or similar.</p>
<p class="text">When social scientists do analysis, writing <b>theoretical memos</b> is part of their process. It&#x2019;s almost like a journal, where you keep track of theories, ideas and questions as they come to you. There&#x2019;s no need to do it in any formal way, as long as you diligently log those ideas and interpretations. It&#x2019;s been described as a &#x2018;conversation with ourselves about our data&#x2019;.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" role="doc-noteref" href="#ch03_en8" id="ch03_enx8">8</a></sup></p>
<p class="text">If that is the output of your analysis, then how is the act of analysis itself performed? Many people struggle with this. Partly it depends on whether the data are quantitative or qualitative. We cover the analytical methods for each data source in relevant sections throughout this book.</p>
<p class="text"><span id="page-29" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 29. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>Don&#x2019;t try to overcomplicate it; to make observations is to record what you see and hear. Engage with the data, constantly asking questions, looking for patterns and making comparisons:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet">What do you find interesting? Why?</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">What patterns are emerging, in this data set as well as between this and other data sets? (See the box &#x2018;Patterns in data&#x2019;.)</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">What differences or similarities do you see between groupings of information?</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Any anomalies? Any outliers?</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Is there any information that helps to confirm or challenge some assumptions or insights previously obtained?</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Ask <i>what if</i>, <i>what now</i> and <i>so what</i> questions.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="text-fo">To make sense of qualitative information, break the haystack into meaningful heaps, creating virtual piles around themes. Scientists refer to this as <b>coding</b>. Start by sorting the individual items into categories, using a word or short phrase as labels.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" role="doc-noteref" href="#ch03_en9" id="ch03_enx9">9</a></sup></p>
<p class="text">Categories of themes will reveal themselves to you as you progress. It&#x2019;s how you start to see links and connections, which is a key part of analysis. It also lets you identify the bigger issues and rank them in order of importance.</p>
<p class="text"><b>Five</b> <b>W</b><b>hys analysis</b> is a popular technique that can be used to explore and evolve ideas. It comes under the umbrella of &#x2018;root cause analysis&#x2019;, a way of identifying the core of a problem.</p>
<p class="text">State the observation or problem, then ask why this is the case. Repeat until you get to a possible root cause.</p>
<p class="text">As you ask the next question, you may realize that you need further data in order to give an informed response. This could be a prompt to access a different data source or even revisit an old one, with fresh perspective. Even if you lack relevant data on which to base your answers, it can be the start of a hypothesis or it can be flagged for further research and analysis.</p>
<p class="text">As an example, let&#x2019;s say you&#x2019;re investigating low mobile conversion rates. The process could develop as illustrated in <a id="rch03_tab_001" href="#ch03_tab_001">Table 3.1</a>.</p>

<h4 id="ch03_boxtitle_001" class="title" epub:type="title">Patterns in data</h4>
<p class="text-fo">Identifying patterns is an important analytical technique. In fact, for some it is the very definition of analysis &#x2013; &#x2018;the search for patterns in data and for ideas that help explain why those patterns are there in the first place&#x2019;.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" role="doc-noteref" href="#ch03_en10" id="ch03_enx10">10</a></sup></p>
<p class="text">Hatch (2002) lists the following types of patterns to look out for in qualitative data sets,<sup><a href="#ch03_en11" id="ch03_enx11">11</a></sup> which equally applies to quantitative analysis:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet">Similarity: things are the same or happen in the same way.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Difference: things are decidedly and predictably dissimilar.</p></li>

<p class="text-fo">Schematizing means organizing information so that relationships and patterns in the data, as well as gaps in your understanding, become apparent.</p>
<p class="text"><b>Data visualization</b> is one of the best ways to make sense of data. It&#x2019;s also effective at communicating your insights to others.</p>
<p class="text">The MIT Media Lab has a program to teach non-technical people how to work with data. The approach of Dr Rahul Bhargava is to have students draw sketches to tell stories with data.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" role="doc-noteref" href="#ch03_en12" id="ch03_enx12">12</a></sup> As you do your analysis, ask yourself if there is anything you can represent visually.</p>
<p class="text">Quantitative data lend themselves naturally to visual representation, such as graphs and charts:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet"><b>Pie charts</b> are best for comparing the parts of a whole, such as new vs returning visitors.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet"><b>Bar charts</b> are good for comparing different groups of data, such as themed survey answers or page templates in a customer journey map.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet"><b>Line graphs</b> are the best way of plotting and comparing trends over time, such as how your conversion rate and revenue have changed over 12 months.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="text-fo">Qualitative data can also be visualized, for example:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet"><b>Mind maps</b> show relationships between different pieces of information. If you read through a list of 200 customer comments, it&#x2019;s hard to keep track in your mind of how it all ties together.</p></li>

<h4 class="head-c">Hypotheses</h4>
<p class="text-fo">Ultimately, the objective of your research is to come up with hypotheses to test. Though it is a separate step later in the process (<a href="14_chapter08.xhtml#ch08_sec_001">Chapter 8</a>), it is firmly grounded in the work you are doing now. Hypotheses start brewing as soon as you start engaging with the data.</p>
<p class="text">As you do the analysis, inevitably theories form in your head. These could be rough ideas about problems or opportunities, based on what you&#x2019;ve observed. It could include thoughts about solutions, but it doesn&#x2019;t have to. It could be an assumption or question that needs further analysis.</p>
<p class="text">Every theory, idea and assumption should be kept in your evidence file, with links to the insights that triggered it.</p>

<section>
<h4 class="head-c"><span id="page-32" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 32. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>Stories</h4>
<p class="text-fo">At the end of each day, review what you&#x2019;ve learnt up until that point. List your three most interesting observations or insights for the day.</p>
<p class="text"><i>Harvard Business Review</i> recommends expressing analysis in narratives: &#x2018;Although good business arguments are developed through the use of numbers, they are typically approved on the basis of a story&#x2026; Storytelling can translate those dry and abstract numbers into compelling pictures of a leader&#x2019;s goals.&#x2019;<sup><a href="#ch03_en13" id="ch03_enx13">13</a></sup></p>
<p class="text">What is the story that&#x2019;s taking shape from your research? Dr Rahul Bhargava from the MIT Media Lab has proposed five data story genres:<sup><a href="#ch03_en14" id="ch03_enx14">14</a></sup></p>
<ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet">Changes over time: a narrative describing how something has changed over a period of time.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Interesting factoids: the most interesting, strange or thought-provoking observation in a data set.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Surprising connections: the human brain responds well to patterns; when a connection is unexpected it raises the story value.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Personal experiences: the protagonist in your story represents a trend or interesting observation found in the data; you could even relate it to your own experience.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Revealing comparisons: intriguing juxtapositions can be created by exposing similarities or differences between things.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="text-fo">You are looking for actionable insights, so your story should contain a twist of how things can be better in the future. Don&#x2019;t worry about proposing a solution just yet; the task is to set up a problem or opportunity and create excitement about making that better.

<h2 id="ch03_h2_003" class="head-a">Problem framing</h2>
<p class="text-fo">So far we&#x2019;ve looked at research mainly from a broad diagnostic perspective, casting the net wide and being open to any and all opportunities.</p>
<p class="text">Sometimes you might feel that there are known opportunities or problems to attack. They may have arisen from a diagnostic sweep or from previous analysis in other areas. It could be a strategic theme for your company with no specific data to back it up.</p>
<p class="text">For example, a big-brand client of our agency has two websites. One is set up to act as a traffic magnet, optimized for organic search. The second site is a pure online shop, optimized for sales. Visitors are funnelled there, seamlessly, <span id="page-33" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 33. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>after landing on the first site. However, web analytics data suggest that those visitors perform poorly relative to other segments. Optimizing this underperforming customer segment was a strategic focus area for the business.</p>
<p class="text">The key difference between the two approaches is that an open diagnostic starts with data, which leads to hypotheses; focusing on a specific opportunity starts with a hypothesis that gets enriched with data.</p>
<p class="text">The essence of problem framing is summarized in this quote, attributed to Albert Einstein: &#x2018;If I had an hour to solve a problem, I&#x2019;d spend 55 minutes thinking about the problem and 5 minutes thinking about the solution.&#x2019;</p>
<p class="text">Problem framing improves clarity around the what and why of a problem. It helps to check assumptions and reduce the risk of working on the wrong things:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet">Exactly what is the problem?</p></li>

<p class="text-fo">The formula below is a useful way to articulate a business problem. While it&#x2019;s focused on the outcome, it is not prescriptive about what the solution looks like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="block-quote">We have observed that [our website/app/component] isn&#x2019;t meeting [these goals], which is causing [this adverse effect/business issue] to our business.</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p class="block-quote">How could we improve [our website/app/component] so that our customers are more successful? We will know we have achieved this by measuring [these measurable criteria].</p>

<p class="text-fo">Once the problem is clearly understood, break it down into questions that can be answered with data. Good questions meet the criteria set out below, making up the acronym FINER:</p>
<ul class="list"><li><p class="list">F &#x2013; Feasible. You have the means, budget and technical expertise to answer the question. This includes access to a relevant data source, with a large enough sample.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><span id="page-34" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 34. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>I  &#x2013; Interesting/Important. The research covers a topic of strategic importance. Answers would be of interest to management and stakeholders.</p></li>
<li><p class="list">N &#x2013; Novel. Just like in the scientific community, your research should generate new knowledge. It should aim to confirm, refute or expand on previous findings.</p></li>
<li><p class="list">E &#x2013; Ethical. Research should be compliant with legal, regulatory, company policy and other relevant frameworks. For example, personally identifiable data have to be processed in accordance with GDPR or its equivalent in your region.</p></li>
<li><p class="list">R &#x2013; Relevant. Does the research really matter to your business? Is a particular question relevant to understanding that problem?</p></li>

<p class="text-fo">E-commerce optimization starts with gathering data to show you where the problems and opportunities are, as well as how much they could be worth to you.</p>
<p class="text">Data in their original state are meaningless. Give them meaning through analysis, which is simply making observations &#x2013; what you see and hear in the data.</p>
<p class="text">The purpose of research is to find actionable insights, not to produce reports with pretty graphs and charts. Insights spawn ideas about how online sales can be increased. Those ideas can then be tested and measured.</p>
<p class="text">You&#x2019;ll use a number of different data sources to get a full picture of the world of your customers, their motivations to purchase as well as the barriers and frustrations they experience on your site.</p>
<p class="text">Quantitative data tell you what is happening, whereas qualitative research can tell you why it is happening. Quantitative research and analysis can help you identify patterns, whereas qualitative research is a good way to discover new insights. Because what people say is not always the same as what they do, you should also aim for a mix of attitudinal and behavioural insights.</p>
