</header>
<p class="text-fo">Joe Girard, in a wonderful rags-to-riches tale, became the world&#x2019;s greatest salesperson against all odds. The title was officially bestowed on him by the <i>Guinness Book of World Records</i> for selling more cars than anyone else.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" role="doc-noteref" href="#ch13_en1" id="ch13_enx1">1</a></sup></p>
<p class="text">After retiring from car sales, he became a prolific writer and shared his mainly self-taught wisdom. From reading his books, it&#x2019;s evident that he understood &#x2013; and applied in practice &#x2013; fundamental principles of the science of buying, despite having no formal education.</p>
<p class="text">He would construct a <b>sales conversation</b>, not around the product, but around the wants and needs of the customer.</p>
<p class="text">In our own work with clients, we like to spend time with their call centre agents (more on this in <a href="11_chapter05.xhtml#ch05_sec_001">Chapter 5</a>). Analysing the sales scripts of successful agents can be revealing for many reasons, but one stands out. The top salespeople would never use the language, phrases and words plastered on their company&#x2019;s website.</p>
<p class="text">This disconnect happens because the site is viewed through the wrong lens &#x2013; pages, user interface, navigation, design elements, copy, images and so on. In website optimization, those things become the focus, so they optimize pages and funnels.</p>
<p class="text">But your site can be viewed through a different lens &#x2013; a sales agent, conducting sales conversations with prospects. Your website visitors don&#x2019;t care much about the site UI and all the rest, as long as it works. They care about themselves, their needs and whether you can help them without ripping them off.</p>
<p class="text">In the process, they may have questions about the product, concerns about the transaction, anxieties about the delivery process and other thoughts running through their mind. In a store, they would pick up an item from the shelf, feel the weight, read the description on the box and ask the assistant a few questions. Online, your website has to do all of that. Seen through that lens, website optimization looks very different.</p>
<p class="text"><span id="page-217" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 217. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>Conversion rate is black and white. A user has either purchased, or not. The reality is not that clear-cut. Half-brewed decisions and &#x2018;almost bought&#x2019; moments are strewn along the way; hurdles and interruptions trip the buying brain before making that final decision. To improve your conversion rate, you have to knock down these brain hurdles, which means aligning your website with the way the buying brain works.</p>
<p class="text">That is the purpose of this chapter.</p>
<section aria-labelledby="ch13_h2_001">
<h2 id="ch13_h2_001" class="head-a">Why do people buy?</h2>
<p class="text-fo">The terms &#x2018;shopping&#x2019; and &#x2018;buying&#x2019; are used interchangeably in everyday conversation, but consumer psychologists make a distinction between the two.</p>
<p class="text">Shopping refers to the entire process of going to the store, and its online equivalent &#x2013; but this doesn&#x2019;t always lead to buying. In fact, &#x2018;going shopping&#x2019; is one of the world&#x2019;s most popular leisure activities, enjoyed for its own sake, regardless of whether anything is purchased.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" role="doc-noteref" href="#ch13_en2" id="ch13_enx2">2</a></sup> People love shopping so much that it&#x2019;s sometimes known as retail therapy, and studies have shown that shopping genuinely does help lift the spirits.</p>
<p class="text">One might think that consuming &#x2013; that is, using the things that we buy &#x2013; is what drives us to make a purchase. In reality it&#x2019;s much more complex than that. Author of <i>Why We Buy</i> Paco Underhill once said, &#x2018;If we went into stores only when we needed to buy something, and if once there we bought only what we needed, the economy would collapse &#x2013; boom.&#x2019;<sup><a href="#ch13_en3" id="ch13_enx3">3</a></sup> In other words, we may shop in order to buy stuff, but we shop for many other reasons too.</p>
<p class="text">Don&#x2019;t think this is limited to shopping malls and the high street. From our own research done on behalf of many retailers, we have seen that a large portion of mobile phone shopping takes place purely because people are trying to find diversion from everyday tasks such as cooking dinner and even having work meetings.</p>
<p class="text">What this means for optimization is that your site is likely to have far more visitors who are there to browse than buy. Your objective is to turn more of them into buyers, more frequently, and get them to spend more when they do buy. Understanding the influences that make them purchase during their shopping activity is therefore a central piece in the puzzle.</p>
<section aria-labelledby="ch13_h3_001">
<h3 id="ch13_h3_001" class="head-b">What makes people buy?</h3>
<p class="text-fo">So we know that people shop for different reasons, and that shopping does not always lead to buying. Then what makes them buy?</p>
<p class="text"><span id="page-218" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 218. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>Often, it is not what it appears to be on the surface; in other words, their goal is not directly related to consuming the purchased product.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" role="doc-noteref" href="#ch13_en4" id="ch13_enx4">4</a></sup> Someone doesn&#x2019;t buy slimming tablets because they want to be taking more pills. Nor even is it to lose weight. No, their goal is seated far deeper &#x2013; to feel better about themselves.</p>
<p class="text">It&#x2019;s the difference between what you are selling and what your customer is buying. A retailer of outdoor clothing for kids may be selling waterproof coats, but what the mum is buying is the rosy-cheeked smile of her child playing happily in the rain.</p>
<p class="text">Later on in the process, if you have identified that core goal you will be able to adjust the sales messages to resonate with your prospective customer. This is about more than just content; it covers every touch point between your &#x2018;online sales team&#x2019; (your website) and the visitor.</p>
<p class="text">One of our clients is a high-end furniture retailer. When we spoke to their customers about why they bought from this company, no one really mentioned the quality of workmanship, the dovetail joints or the flawless paint finishes. It turns out the reason they bought was because it made them feel special. &#x2018;My guests always comment on things I buy from here,&#x2019; a happy customer said. Their core goal was purely emotional, to be admired for their uniquely stylish taste.</p>
<p class="text">That&#x2019;s why it&#x2019;s so important in e-commerce optimization to be aware of the true reasons why your customers buy and how the decision-making process works. In the situation above, it would be easy to fall into the trap of thinking that people would be keen to own these particular homewares for the sake of practical utility. That would lead you to follow a feature-driven hard-sell approach, which would miss out on so many opportunities to get your site performing to its full potential.</p>
</section>
<section aria-labelledby="ch13_h3_002">
<h3 id="ch13_h3_002" class="head-b">Are you selling to 5 per cent of the brain?</h3>
<p class="text-fo">Our brains have two different modes of processing information, known as System 1 (the ancient, unconscious brain) and System 2 (the modern, conscious brain).</p>
<p class="text">One of the best explanations of this is by Nobel Prize winner Daniel Kahneman in his book, <i>Thinking, Fast and Slow</i>.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" role="doc-noteref" href="#ch13_en5" id="ch13_enx5">5</a></sup> He colourfully describes how when we buy anything, these two systems can create internal tension.</p>
<p class="text">Every thought enters the brain via the subconscious System 1, which deals with things automatically and rapidly. Thus the overwhelming <span id="page-219" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 219. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>majority of thoughts, including purchase decisions, are processed subconsciously. It happens on autopilot, in a flash.</p>
<p class="text">Only about 5 per cent of our decisions and behaviours are escalated to the rational and analytical System 2. This implies that 95 per cent of the time, your customers have made their buying decision before they&#x2019;re even aware of it. When conscious thinking takes over, everything gets more complex and nailing a decision becomes difficult. Clearly this is something you want to avoid, because it makes people less likely to buy.</p>
<p class="text">If you understand how System 1 and System 2 work, you can use this information to your advantage. At every stage of the optimization process, remember that by the time the conscious mind gets involved, the decision has already been made.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" role="doc-noteref" href="#ch13_en6" id="ch13_enx6">6</a></sup> When you create treatments to test, check if they appeal to System 1 thinking. By the time System 2 thinking kicks in, its job is to justify the purchase, rather than putting up intellectual barriers that rationalize against buying.</p>
<p class="text">You will almost certainly have lots of System 2 reasons already to hand as to why your customers should buy from you. The optimization process will help you uncover &#x2018;System 1&#x2019; motivations that you can incorporate into your website.</p>
<p class="text">Roger Dooley, a world-leading neuroscientist who specializes in retail, strongly advocates leading with content that appeals to System 1&#x2019;s emotional and subconscious needs. That means presenting benefits rather than features. The difference is that features are what a product is or does, while benefits are what it does for the user. Features describe what you are selling &#x2013; benefits are what the user is really buying.</p>
<p class="text">Sales messages that are dominated by prices, discounts and features tend to tip the balance towards System 2 brain activity.</p>
<p class="text">There is also a difference between the benefit <i>per se</i> and how it is dramatized creatively. <a id="rch13_tab_001" href="#ch13_tab_001">Table 13.1</a> lists three examples to illustrate this.</p>

<p id="ch13_tabskip_001" class="text-fo">One retailer that does this well is Zappos, the online shoe store. They use large images on the product detail pages, which trigger an emotional response from System 1. Factual data are placed behind a link, where System 2 can access it to rationalize the purchase decision, but where it&#x2019;s less likely to get in the way of that initial decision.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" role="doc-noteref" href="#ch13_en7" id="ch13_enx7">7</a></sup></p>

<section aria-labelledby="ch13_h2_002">
<h2 id="ch13_h2_002" class="head-a">Six principles of influence</h2>
<p class="text-fo">One of the best-known experts on persuasive psychology is Dr Robert Cialdini, author of the chart-topping book, <i>Influence: The</i> <i>psychology of persuasion</i>. Having studied how to appeal to the subconscious over decades, he offers six ways of getting people &#x2018;to say &#x201C;yes&#x201D; without thinking first&#x2019;.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" role="doc-noteref" href="#ch13_en8" id="ch13_enx8">8</a></sup></p>
<section aria-labelledby="ch13_h3_003">
<h3 id="ch13_h3_003" class="head-b">Reciprocation</h3>
<p class="text-fo">A client of ours discovered one of their most effective customer acquisition methods with a very interesting experiment. They sent out printed catalogues, half of which included a unique free gift. The response rate to those catalogues, with the free gift, is 3 &#x00D7; 4 higher than the standard package.</p>
<p class="text">Imagine trekking through London&#x2019;s shopping district. It&#x2019;s cold, and you&#x2019;re tired from walking around. A store in Regent Street catches your attention. On arrival, the assistant offers you a cup of delicious warm herbal tea. An innocent, generous gesture? Maybe, but there&#x2019;s more to it. That cup is likely to create a feeling of indebtedness towards the shop assistant, easily settled by, well, buying something. This is because the rule of reciprocation asserts that any favour or gift has to be returned. The free unexpected gift is also used by some e-commerce retailers.</p>
<p class="text">The rule of reciprocation is so fundamental to the human make-up that it applies to all cultures all over the world.</p>
<p class="text">An interesting variation of this rule is what Cialdini calls rejection-then-retreat. I recently experienced this when buying a new jacket. The store manager first showed me an enormously expensive jacket. When I made it clear that this was way beyond my budget, he didn&#x2019;t skip a beat and quickly <span id="page-221" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 221. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>emerged with a similar item about half the price. What a deal! Psychologically, because the second price appears to be small in comparison with the first one, the shopper reacts favourably &#x2013; a principle known as price anchoring.</p>
</section>
<section aria-labelledby="ch13_h3_004">
<h3 id="ch13_h3_004" class="head-b">Commitment and consistency</h3>
<p class="text-fo">Once we&#x2019;ve committed to doing something, we face internal and societal tension if we don&#x2019;t see it through. To avoid that, we have an innate drive to be consistent with earlier actions and decisions.</p>
<p class="text">You can use this to your advantage in surprisingly subtle ways. For example, if you want someone to fill in an online form, initially you may just ask for some small piece of information such as a name or e-mail address. The theory is that, once they&#x2019;ve started the process by giving you those data, they&#x2019;ve made a commitment and will be more willing to give much larger information later.</p>
<p class="text">Another example is requesting a catalogue on a retailer&#x2019;s website, which leads to the expectation of buying something from that catalogue.</p>
</section>
<section aria-labelledby="ch13_h3_005">
<h3 id="ch13_h3_005" class="head-b">Social proof</h3>
<p class="text-fo">We tend to look at the actions of others for clues on how we should behave. In situations where there&#x2019;s any uncertainty, we are especially likely to copy their behaviour.</p>
<p class="text">So powerful is this mechanism that it has been employed to cure a fear of dogs in children. Cialdini explains how researchers showed them clips of other kids playing with dogs. Within four days of watching the videos, two-thirds of them were petting the same dogs they were previously scared of.</p>
<p class="text">This is one of the most commonly applied techniques in e-commerce. Examples include testimonials, highlighting best sellers and showing the number of Facebook likes. We find comfort in the knowledge that others are there with us, or have trodden the path before us. Hence the saying: &#x2018;safety in numbers&#x2019;.</p>
<p class="text">This principle came into play in one project we ran for a large website selling flowers. Adding a simple banner stating &#x2018;Over 10 Million Bouquets Delivered&#x2019; produced an increase of 6 per cent in revenue per visitor (<a id="rch13_fig_001" href="#ch13_fig_001">Figure 13.1</a>). Our research had pointed to a lack of familiarity with the <span id="page-222" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 222. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>brand being a barrier to buying. The banner gave people the social proof they needed that many others trust the brand, and thus made them feel it was a legitimate site and safe to order.</p>

<section aria-labelledby="ch13_h3_006">
<h3 id="ch13_h3_006" class="head-b">Liking</h3>
<p class="text-fo">We are more likely to buy from those we like. One perhaps slightly controversial method cited by Cialdini is showing photographs of attractive people. Only if it&#x2019;s relevant to your product, I should add.</p>
<p class="text">The world&#x2019;s best salesperson understood this instinctively. Joe Girard, whom you met at the start of this chapter, wrote in his book <i>How to Sell Anything to</i> <i>Anybody</i>: &#x2018;One of the most important determining factors of a sale is: Does the prospect like, trust and believe me?&#x2019;<sup><a href="#ch13_en9" id="ch13_enx9">9</a></sup></p>
<p class="text">You can invoke liking by creating the suggestion of similarity. We want to associate with people like us. Girard tried to dress like his customers. Online, you could do this by using the same language as your customers. What you often find, instead, is platitudinal corporate speak and marketing waffle.</p>
<p class="text">Another example is using carefully selected testimonials to align with your target personas. Some e-commerce sites have even used the old, boring About Us page to introduce liking, by depicting the team as friendly, honest people &#x2013; just like you and me.</p>
<p class="text">Girard would approve.</p>
</section>
<section aria-labelledby="ch13_h3_007">
<h3 id="ch13_h3_007" class="head-b">Authority</h3>
<p class="text-fo">We are easily influenced by authority figures, especially those with credentials such as &#x2018;doctor&#x2019;, &#x2018;professor&#x2019; and so on. This can also be achieved by quoting from authoritative sources, for example citing studies, showing <span id="page-223" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 223. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>excerpts from academic journals or even just a photograph of someone in a white coat.</p>
<p class="text">In <a href="11_chapter05.xhtml#ch05_sec_001">Chapter 5</a>, you saw an example of this technique in <a href="11_chapter05.xhtml#ch05_fig_002">Figure 5.2</a>. The well-known avian veterinary surgeon is a trusted figure among target customers.</p>
</section>
<section aria-labelledby="ch13_h3_008">
<h3 id="ch13_h3_008" class="head-b">Scarcity</h3>
<p class="text-fo">Value tends to increase as supply comes under pressure, so we are more likely to buy something if stock is low. Daily deals sites are designed to exploit this principle.</p>
</section>
<section aria-labelledby="ch13_h3_009">
<h3 id="ch13_h3_009" class="head-b">Bonus: The rule of material self-interest</h3>
<p class="text-fo">People want to maximize gains and minimize cost; in other words, they want to get the most for the lowest possible price. This seventh principle is given only scant attention by Cialdini in his foreword, explaining that it is such an obvious factor that it was deliberately omitted from the official list.</p>
<p class="text">Lowest price does not always mean cheapest and it&#x2019;s not always monetary value alone that&#x2019;s important, but the whole experience. The perception of a good deal often counts for more than the actual price.</p>
<p class="text">In fact, when we spot something we want for a lot less than expected, our brains light up with pleasure in exactly the same place as when people take heroin, according to research by Dr David Lewis.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" role="doc-noteref" href="#ch13_en10" id="ch13_enx10">10</a></sup> When it comes to snapping up a bargain, it seems we just can&#x2019;t resist.</p>

<h2 id="ch13_h2_003" class="head-a">The buying decision-making process</h2>
<p class="text-fo">An e-commerce transaction doesn&#x2019;t start, or end for that matter, with a purchase. The purchase is the only visible link in a chain of events that starts much earlier, and continues beyond the point where the transaction is concluded. The buying decision-making process<sup><a href="#ch13_en11" id="ch13_enx11">11</a></sup> is a well-known framework that shows the mental stages consumers pass through when buying products:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet">Need recognition</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Information search</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Evaluation of alternatives</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet"><span id="page-224" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 224. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>Purchase of product</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Post-purchase evaluation</p></li></ul>
<section aria-labelledby="ch13_h3_014">
<h3 id="ch13_h3_014" class="head-b">Need recognition</h3>
<p class="text-fo">Without a need, there can&#x2019;t be a purchase. Not only that, but it influences everything around the purchase decision, and even satisfaction levels after purchase.</p>
<p class="text">To quote Joe Girard again: &#x2018;The more you understand about their needs and wants, the better equipped you&#x2019;ll be to provide them with the right solution.&#x2019;<sup><a href="#ch13_en12" id="ch13_enx12">12</a></sup></p>
<p class="text">This is why it&#x2019;s so crucial to really understand your customer&#x2019;s core need, which is what <a href="11_chapter05.xhtml#ch05_sec_001">Chapter 5</a> is devoted to.</p>
</section>
<section aria-labelledby="ch13_h3_015">
<h3 id="ch13_h3_015" class="head-b">Information search</h3>
<p class="text-fo">Once the need is recognized, consumers search for information about potential solutions. They might do a Google search, ask friends for recommendations or look at customer reviews. Purchases of everyday goods also pass through this step, but we tend to use memory recall or previous experience to find the information.</p>
<p class="text">With tools like Google Analytics, it&#x2019;s possible to see what search terms visitors used to find your site. You may observe that some phrases relate to early exploratory stages, while others are closer to the next step of evaluating alternatives.</p>
</section>
<section aria-labelledby="ch13_h3_010">
<h3 id="ch13_h3_010" class="head-b">Evaluation</h3>
<p class="text-fo">Having completed their information search, your potential customer now has a range of possibilities. It may amount to nothing but price comparison, which is so easy online. In that case, you have to justify your prices, if you aren&#x2019;t the lowest in the market. Key here is your value proposition, which we discuss in <a href="11_chapter05.xhtml#ch05_sec_001">Chapter 5</a>.</p>
<p class="text">One of our clients is a famous electronic goods brand. The major sales objection on their website is that the same products can be bought at prices up to 20 per cent less from popular retail outlets. Our research revealed that their customers were prepared to pay more for the promise of global warranties, availability of the full product range and a fear of buying inferior &#x2018;grey&#x2019; imports from department stores. That knowledge enabled us to mirror it back at visitors, boosting their perception of value.</p>
<p class="text"><span id="page-225" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 225. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>Other factors that can help consumers narrow down options include product attributes and brand perception. Different attributes appeal to different people. You may think you know what matters to customers, but it&#x2019;s always worth checking this with surveys. Brand perception is a subjective judgement based on things like the look and feel of your site, and the content and tone of your messages (<a id="rch13_fig_002" href="#ch13_fig_002">Figure 13.2</a>). Be sensitive to that when creating alternative designs to test.</p>

<p class="figure"><a href="#rch13_fig_002"><span class="label" epub:type="label">Figure</span> <span class="ordinal" epub:type="ordinal">13.2</span> Our client, a famous retail chain, makes the evaluation of alternatives easier by offering a great variety of product images. This invokes System 1 thinking by subtly answering key questions that a customer may have. What is the shape? How thick is it? How large is it? What is the texture like? These can all be answered subconsciously by looking at this collection of images. By the time the user examines product copy, it may be just a matter of System 2 rationalizing the decision, already made subconsciously by then</a></p>

However, just because a potential customer made a choice in the Evaluation stage, there is no guarantee they will conclude the transaction. Some evidence of this can be seen in the high percentage of baskets that get abandoned &#x2013; an average of 69.57 per cent across the board at the time of writing.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" role="doc-noteref" href="#ch13_en13" id="ch13_enx13">13</a></sup></p>

<h3 id="ch13_h3_012" class="head-b">Post-purchase behaviour</h3>
<p class="text-fo">After making the purchase, your customer evaluates to what extent the product meets their original need. Whether or not those expectations are met determines customer satisfaction. In some cases the consumer will do another round of information search, this time to confirm that they&#x2019;ve made the right decision. In behavioural psychology this is known as an attempt to reduce post-purchase cognitive dissonance, or buyer&#x2019;s remorse, which is surprisingly common. What they experience at this point can influence future sales.</p>

<h2 id="ch13_h2_004" class="head-a">FBM model of behaviour</h2>
<p class="text-fo">Now that we&#x2019;ve examined the decision-making process that precedes action, it&#x2019;s time to take a closer look at the action component itself. What makes people take a desired action, such as buying a product from your site?</p>
<p class="text">Dr B J Fogg of Stanford University sheds light on this question with the Fogg Behavioural Model (FBM). It does a great job of capturing the fundamentals of complex human behaviour. For any given behaviour to occur, three things need to fall into place at the same time: motivation, ability and trigger (<a id="rch13_fig_003" href="#ch13_fig_003">Figure 13.3</a>).</p>

<p class="figure-alt-long">Ability on the horizontal axis shows from &#x2018;hard to do&#x2019; to &#x2018;easy to do&#x2019; and motivation on the vertical axis shows from low to high. The action line drops down from high motivation to easy to do. The part below the line shows triggers fail here and the part above the line shows triggers succeed here. An equation on the graph shows B (behaviour) equals m (motivation) a (ability) and t (trigger) at the same moment.</p>

<p class="text-fo">What this means for e-commerce optimization:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet">Understand the customer&#x2019;s core motivation:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet-sub">
<li><p class="list-bullet-sub">Motivation refers to how strongly the individual is driven to act. Ability relates to how easy it is for that individual to take the desired action &#x2013; this is usability in our context.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet-sub">Throughout this book, we emphasize the importance of understanding your customer&#x2019;s core motivation. One of the best ways to do that is with the qualitative research methods discussed in <a href="11_chapter05.xhtml#ch05_sec_001">Chapter 5</a>.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet-sub">Studies have shown that highly motivated users actually underestimate usability difficulties.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" role="doc-noteref" href="#ch13_en14" id="ch13_enx14">14</a></sup> Therefore, someone with high motivation may be influenced to act by improving usability. It&#x2019;s one of the most effective interventions. A good way to identify these opportunities is by doing remote moderated usability testing, covered in <a href="10_chapter04.xhtml#ch04_sec_001">Chapter 4</a>.</p></li></ul></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Align your sales conversation with their needs and wants:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet-sub">
<li><p class="list-bullet-sub">Your visitor will not take action without a trigger, even when motivation and ability are both high. Consequently, this is an area you want to be paying attention to. If the need is strong enough, it could act as a trigger. But you can create triggers too, for example e-mails with discount codes, and the offer of free delivery above a certain basket value. How about your calls to action? Is the button visible? Does the copy resonate with the user&#x2019;s need? Are you infusing triggers with benefits and features, when an appeal to System 1 thinking would be more appropriate?</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet-sub">Timing is everything, says Fogg. A trigger at a time when either motivation or ability is low will not result in a sale. All three ingredients have to come together, at the same time, for the credit card number to be punched in.</p></li></ul></li>

<p class="text">On the mobile page shown in <a id="rch13_fig_004" href="#ch13_fig_004">Figure 13.4</a>, motivation is high and ability is there to click through. However, the trigger is weak.

<p class="text-fo">The job of your website is to conduct a sales conversation with the prospect. That should be the focus of your optimization efforts, rather than pages and funnels.</p>
<p class="text"> To influence behaviour, you have to recognize and understand it. Being familiar with the basic principles covered in this chapter will serve you well. It will shape your analysis, help you formulate better hypotheses and improve your ability to make sense of experiments.</p>
<p class="text"> We tend to view buying as a simple yes/no decision. In fact, it&#x2019;s not black and white, but several shades of grey. About 95 per cent of all decisions happen subconsciously. This means that we tend to purchase with emotion more than rational deliberation &#x2013; even if we think we don&#x2019;t.</p>
<p class="text"> As a consequence, throughout your optimization process, you should be trying to identify the core needs and motivations of your target customers so that you can align your approach with that.</p>
<p class="text"> The FBM model explains that motivation alone is not enough to make someone buy. There must also be a trigger and ability. In the context of optimization, this means aligning the sales conversation with customer needs as well as improving the usability of the website.</p>
