<p class="text-fo">Spotify have developed their own framework, called DIBB. It stands for Data&#x2013;Insight&#x2013;Belief&#x2013;Bet.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" role="doc-noteref" href="#ch08_en1" id="ch08_enx1">1</a></sup> It&#x2019;s similar to the one in this book, but with a deliberately different vocabulary. This subtle departure aims to foster a mindset and environment conducive to experimentation.</p>
<p class="text">The first two steps &#x2013; Data and Insights &#x2013; should be familiar to you. In <a href="09_chapter03.xhtml#ch03_sec_001">Chapter 3</a>, we discussed how data breed insights through analysis and sensemaking. Some years back, Spotify noticed a trend that mobile usage was rising sharply, while desktop usage was declining. The insight, that mobile would soon dominate, prompted suggestions of radical change throughout the organization.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" role="doc-noteref" href="#ch08_en2" id="ch08_enx2">2</a></sup></p>
<p class="text"><i>Belief</i>, the third step in DIBB, refers to our interpretation of the data and insights, how we make sense of data and the meaning we attach to them. Belief is personal. According to the dictionary, it is &#x2018;the feeling of being certain that something exists or is true&#x2019;.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" role="doc-noteref" href="#ch08_en3" id="ch08_enx3">3</a></sup></p>
<p class="text"><i>Bet</i> suggests there are two possible outcomes. That&#x2019;s the beauty of this phrasing; everyone understands what it means: it could go your way, but there&#x2019;s an equal chance it could swing the other way.</p>
<p class="text">In a more traditional or scientific framework, the bet would be similar to an experiment. Like a bet, there is always a chance that the test doesn&#x2019;t win.</p>
<p class="text">The equivalent of a belief would be a hypothesis. While it is something you believe to be true, you are not emotionally invested in it.</p>
<section aria-labelledby="ch08_h2_001">
<h2 id="ch08_h2_001" class="head-a">What is a hypothesis?</h2>
<p class="text-fo">A hypothesis is a statement about cause and effect, based on what you believe to be true. If you change <i>x</i>, you believe <i>y</i> will happen. In e-commerce optimization, it is a prediction that making a change to the website will result in a positive outcome.</p>
<p class="text">A well-formulated hypothesis:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet"><span id="page-134" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 134. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>Links to data. State the observations which inform what you believe to be true about the current situation.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Shows cause and effect. What will you change, and what will be the effect of that change?</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Can be measured. How will the effect be measured, what metric(s) can be used to track and report the impact of the change(s)?</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Is testable. You must be able to run an experiment that can disprove your prediction.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="text-fo">Optimization specialist Craig Sullivan proposed the following framework, which has been widely adopted:</p>
<ol class="list-number"><li><p class="list-number">Because we saw [qual &#x0026; quant data].</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number">We expect that [change] for [population] will cause [impact(s)].</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number">We expect to see [data metric(s) change] over a period of [x business cycles].<sup><a epub:type="noteref" role="doc-noteref" href="#ch08_en4" id="ch08_enx4">4</a></sup></p></li>
</ol>
<p class="text-fo">Apart from satisfying all the conditions mentioned earlier, using this format means you are truly focused on the users and their needs. It helps you to test things that are meaningful to both your customers and the business.</p>
<p class="text">Below is an example of a hypothesis using this format. It was for a homewares retailer, where merchandise can be bought on credit:</p>
<ol class="list-number"><li><p class="list-number">Because we observed a large drop-off between the product and basket page (quant), and users were confused about which items were included in a bedding set (qual).</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number">We expect that making the most popular bedding set the default option, and offering a pop-up to &#x2018;View Bedding Set&#x2019; with a complete list of items (change) for users on bedding set PDPs (population), would lead to an increase in sales of bedding products (impact).</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number">We expect to see the sales conversion rate increase for bedding products (metric change) over a period of four weeks (two business cycles).</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="text-fo">The detail around population and number of business cycles can be dropped to simplify the formula, as below:</p>
<ol class="list-number"><li><p class="list-number">Because we saw [qual &#x0026; quant data].</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number">We expect that [change]&#x2026; will cause [impact(s)].</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number">We expect to see [data metric(s) change].<sup><a epub:type="noteref" role="doc-noteref" href="#ch08_en5" id="ch08_enx5">5</a></sup></p></li>
</ol>
<p class="text-fo">In the example below, this simplified formula is used. The context is the same as the first example above, but a different qualitative observation prompted a different treatment:</p>
<ol class="list-number"><li><p class="list-number"><span id="page-135" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 135. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>Because we observed a large drop-off between the product and basket page (quant), and users had concerns about whether they could afford the repayments, wondering if there was some kind of &#x2018;deal&#x2019; (qual).</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number">We expect that giving more prominence to the finance calculator (change) would increase revenue per visitor (impact).</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number">We expect to see more clicks on the calculator and an increase in average order value (metric changes).</p></li>
</ol>

<section aria-labelledby="ch08_h2_002">
<h2 id="ch08_h2_002" class="head-a">Why you need hypotheses</h2>
<p class="text-fo">A hypothesis sets you up to learn something from the experiment. It provides the basis on which causation (x leads to y) is established.</p>
<p class="text">Part 3 of the above formula defines how that causal link is established. If the metric goes up, it bolsters confidence in our theory. If it does not go up, the hypothesis is disproved. But you can learn from that. It means you have to rethink a belief or assumption.</p>
<p class="text">Either way, a good hypothesis is the first step in gaining insight from the test. It defines what you will learn, in advance. A failed experiment is not one where your variation &#x2018;lost&#x2019; to the control. You only fail if you don&#x2019;t learn anything from a test.</p>
<p class="text">Some insights are so unique that they can only be obtained from a negative test result. If an insight obtained in that way gives rise to a win down the line, the initial &#x2018;failed&#x2019; test must surely take the credit for subsequent success. The shoe retailer case study at the end of this section (see <a id="rch08_fig_001" href="#ch08_fig_001">Figures 8.1</a>&#x2013;<a id="rch08_fig_003" href="#ch08_fig_003">8.3</a>) shows how a negative experiment led us to a win.</p>
<p class="text">Dr Flint McLaughlin of research group MECLABS is emphatic about this: &#x2018;The goal of a test is not to get a lift, but rather to get a learning.&#x2019;<sup><a href="#ch08_en6" id="ch08_enx6">6</a></sup></p>
<p class="text">If the metric goes down, you can look back at the hypothesis to enhance your understanding. That negative result tells you that the variable being tested caused visitors to behave in a different way from what you expected. The question then is, why?</p>
<p class="text">Fortunately, an experiment creates a pool of data that you can review to arrive at an answer to that question. Because this new insight is specific to the problem being treated, it can bring you a step closer to a winning solution. Revise the hypothesis accordingly and run a follow-on test.</p>
<p class="text">If there really is an opportunity, a different treatment (part 2 in the hypothesis formula) should produce a different result next time.</p>
<aside id="ch08_aside_001" class="case-study" role="complementary" epub:type="case-study" aria-labelledby="ch08_boxtitle_001">
<h3 id="ch08_boxtitle_001" class="title" epub:type="title"><span id="page-136" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 136. " epub:type="pagebreak"/><span class="txt-capitalize"><b>Case Study</b></span></h3>
<p class="text-fo">A negative test result does not signal the end of the road. It simply means that the hypothesis is not valid and you should learn from it. If you&#x2019;ve used the formula suggested in this chapter, you will be able to draw valuable insights from a &#x2018;loss&#x2019;. This brings you a step closer to a winning solution, as this case study illustrates.</p>
<p class="text">When working with shoe retailers, we often find size and fit concerns among users. This anxiety is so strong that many people don&#x2019;t buy the shoes, even if they really like them.</p>
<p class="text">We worked with a large international shoe brand where this effect was pronounced. <a href="#ch08_fig_001">Figure 8.1</a> shows the original product detail page template. On heatmaps, we could see that a large percentage of users were clicking on the &#x2018;Size Information&#x2019; tab. User feedback from on-site surveys suggested that the information in that tab was not helpful.</p>

<p class="figure-media"><img src="images/M08NF001.jpg" alt="A template for product detail page shows product title, price, size and colour information tabs."/></p>
</figure>
<p class="text-fo">One solution invoked the principle of social proof, discussed in <a href="19_chapter13.xhtml#ch13_sec_001">Chapter 13</a>. A survey was sent out to all recent customers, asking them to rate how well the shoes they had purchased fitted them. They rated it on a scale from 1 to 3, where 1 = too small and 3 = too large.</p>
<p class="text">We hypothesized that this form of social proof would reduce anxiety about how the shoes would fit. The first iteration of the experiment, shown in <a id="rch08_fig_002" href="#ch08_fig_002">Figure 8.2</a>, used the white space above the size selector. It placed the treatment very prominently in the eye path, so all users would see it.</p>
<figure class="figure" id="ch08_fig_002"><figcaption>
<p class="figure"><a href="#rch08_fig_002"><span class="label" epub:type="label"><span id="page-137" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 137.

<p class="text-fo">That first test was negative. RPV was down 12 per cent and secondary metrics, tracked as part of the test, revealed a marked reduction in clicks on the &#x2018;Size Information&#x2019; tab.</p>
<p class="text">We hypothesized that the social proof element had been given too much prominence. It now had the opposite effect, and was raising anxiety levels. Our hypothesis was that it would be more effective if folded into the &#x2018;Size Information&#x2019; tab, as there it would be seen in the right context. This formed the basis for the second iteration (<a href="#ch08_fig_003">Figure 8.3</a>), which delivered in increase of 7.9 per cent in RPV.</p>

<section>
<h4 class="head-c">Wireframe</h4>
<p class="text-fo">A wireframe is a visual representation of the change(s) being proposed. It&#x2019;s primarily a communications tool to visualize the treatment as defined by your hypothesis statement. It sketches out the bare bones of the test variation.</p>
<p class="text">Typically it goes through a few iterations, increasing in fidelity along the way. It may start as a simple low-fidelity (lo-fi) line drawing showing just the rough outlines of the proposed structure and layout (<a id="rch08_fig_004" href="#ch08_fig_004">Figure 8.4</a>). This is a useful first step if the treatment represents a significant departure from the current design, but if changes are subtle you can skip this and jump straight into the detail.</p>
<figure class="figure" id="ch08_fig_004"><figcaption>
<p class="figure"><a href="#rch08_fig_004"><span class="label" epub:type="label">Figure</span> <span class="ordinal" epub:type="ordinal">8.4</span> Early-stage lo-fi wireframe, created with Whimsical. It shows just the outlines of a mobile screen redesign</a></p>
</figcaption>
<p class="figure-media"><img src="images/M08NF004.jpg" alt="A sample low fidelity line drawing on a smart phone shows a rough outline of proposed design."/></p>
</figure>
<p class="text-fo">Eventually, the wireframe should sketch out what the proposed treatment will look like. There is a fine balance between showing the vital elements while, at the same time, cluttering it with unnecessary detail. Though there are no rules on this, here are some tips from our experience:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet">Produce separate wireframes for different device types such as desktop and mobile.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet"><span id="page-140" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 140. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>Focus on the hypothesis and user behaviour you want to influence and remember that the wireframe is not meant to be a final design.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">When it is compared against the existing page, it should be clear which new elements are being introduced (eg new sections, lightboxes and pop-ups) as well as which elements have been removed.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Use actual copy, not <i>lorem ipsum</i> (filler text), to show how the words are contributing to the change in visitor behaviour you want to test. There is more on this in the next section.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="text-fo">The case study at the end of this chapter shows an example of a wireframe (<a id="rch08_fig_005" href="#ch08_fig_005">Figure 8.5</a>) and how it was translated into a final design (<a id="rch08_fig_006" href="#ch08_fig_006">Figure 8.6</a>). The lack of polish helps to keep the focus on the core functionality and the variables that are intended to alter user behaviour. What matters is that it clearly shows key changes and helps the team to visualize the proposed test.</p>
<p class="text">Three reasons why it is important that a wireframe is lo-fi and looks somewhat unfinished:</p>
<ol class="list-number"><li><p class="list-number">The &#x2018;work-in-progress&#x2019; nature of the wireframe allows everyone to focus on the core experience and functionality of the web page rather than getting distracted by pretty pictures.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number">The wireframe is a device to gather feedback. People are naturally polite, and when they are shown something very highly polished they are reluctant to criticize. A line drawing is clearly only work in progress, so reviewers are much more likely to say what they really think.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number">You can expect a lot of changes between your first and your final version of your wireframe. It will be seen by customers and peers, and their feedback will be incorporated into the final version. It is much quicker and more cost-effective to simply create a new wireframe rather than amend polished artwork time and again.</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="text-fo">Specialist wireframing tools are available to make it quick and easy to create a wireframe. They usually come with grids and pre-set shapes and buttons to insert. Here are a few options to consider:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet">Balsamiq: One of our all-time favourites, perfect for lo-fi wireframing (see <a href="#ch08_fig_005">Figure 8.5</a> for example).</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Whimsical: Another favourite, easy to use, sexy interface and well priced (see <a href="#ch08_fig_004">Figure 8.4</a> for example).</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Justinmind: Basic wireframing is free; paid version offers more advanced capabilities and interactive prototyping.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet"><span id="page-141" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 141. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>OmniGraffle: Only for Mac and iOS. Expect a learning curve, in exchange for which you get a powerful tool including automation with JavaScript or AppleScript.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Axure: Long established, capable of handling dynamic content, conditional logic and adaptive views for different screen sizes.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Moqups: Boasts an extensive range of stencils for popular use cases, as well as big collections of icons and fonts. (The wireframes in <a href="#ch08_fig_001">Figures 8.1</a>&#x2013;<a href="#ch08_fig_003">8.3</a> were done in Moqups.)</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">InVision: Very popular for high-fidelity wireframing and interactive prototyping; we are especially fond of the collaboration features.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Figma: From lo-fi wireframes through prototyping to final design, Figma is the preferred tool of UX Designers on many teams, including ours.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section>
<h4 class="head-c">Copy</h4>
<p class="text-fo">Copy is an essential part of the wireframe, and the exact wording can make a big difference to the impact of a test variation. At <a href="https://Booking.com"><span class="url-hyperlink">Booking.com</span></a>, some of the biggest wins come from small copy changes.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" role="doc-noteref" href="#ch08_en7" id="ch08_enx7">7</a></sup> This can be extremely subtle, like a short phrase or even just one word &#x2013; also called microcopy.</p>
<p class="text">The reason why copy changes are so powerful is because they form the sales conversation. The site acts as a salesperson. A prospect has questions about the product and delivery, as well as anxieties and sales objections. The role of copy is to move them through the purchase cycle.</p>
<p class="text">Often the first step is to work out exactly what the requirements of the message are at that particular point, rather than trying to write compelling copy straight off the bat. Is the purpose to educate the visitor? Help them find their way around? Clarify a complex point? Persuade them to take an action?</p>
<p class="text">Use the early-stage lo-fi wireframe to work out where to put headlines and subheads to make the text scannable. Later on in the process, show actual words on the wireframe, in the right hierarchy, with more prominence given to important messages. Messages should be carefully placed to guide the viewer to the intended action.</p>
<p class="text">Once you are clear about what the copy needs to convey, you can then rewrite it using copywriting techniques to give it the best chance of achieving its objectives. Here are some of the most valuable techniques:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet">Start with an active word such as &#x2018;Discover&#x2019; or &#x2018;Enjoy&#x2019; rather than passive words like &#x2018;this&#x2019; or &#x2018;A&#x2019; or &#x2018;That&#x2019;.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Cut out unnecessary words.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet"><span id="page-142" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 142. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>Use embedded commands such as &#x2018;You want that drink to be cold and refreshing&#x2019;.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Write in the present continuous tense: &#x2018;a luminous teapot adds fun and colour to your kitchen&#x2019; rather than future tense &#x2018;a luminous teapot will add fun and colour to your kitchen&#x2019;. Banish the word &#x2018;will&#x2019;. This technique works because it communicates directly with the subconscious brain. Phrased as if something is actually happening right now, the reader imagines themselves using the product or pictures it in their home.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Speak directly to the reader, by using words like &#x2018;you&#x2019; and &#x2018;your&#x2019;, rather than writing passively in the third person, with phrases like &#x2018;we&#x2019;ve worked hard&#x2019;.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Change company-centric messages (&#x2018;Our biggest-ever range&#x2019;) into customer-benefit statements (&#x2018;Your biggest-ever choice&#x2019;).</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Assume the sale. Write as if it&#x2019;s tacitly agreed that they are going to buy the product, and talk about &#x2018;when you have luminous teapots in your home&#x2019; rather than &#x2018;if you buy the luminous teapots&#x2019;.</p></li>
</ul>

<p class="text-fo">It is in the nature of creative work that there could be more than one viable creative solution. We find it useful to get feedback before launching the test, especially from team members who understand the problem being solved.</p>
<p class="text">Some practitioners also invite open feedback from the users who took part in earlier usability testing.

Limit it to questions related to user interaction; for example, &#x2018;where would you click&#x2019;, &#x2018;what would you expect to happen if&#x2026;&#x2019; and so on.</p>
<p class="text">The reviewers can add to your thinking, spot gaps and generally act as a checkweight to make sure that the solution you are proposing in the wireframe genuinely solves the problem. They may also come up with other creative solutions, adding valuable dimensions to your idea.</p>
<p class="text">Coordinate all the feedback from colleagues and users to determine whether this version of the wireframe and copy can be improved, before it proceeds to artwork. Many of the wireframing tools listed earlier incorporate a collaborative element. There are tools designed around collecting and coordinating comments, such as Red Pen, Notism, Cage and Miro.</p>
<p class="text">Upload an image of the wireframe together with a description of the changes you have made. The aim is to give your reviewers enough background to be able to make informed comments. Include key information and some background to the wireframe, such as:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet">What is the problem you&#x2019;re solving, for which audience?</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">If the test is an iteration, what are the learnings so far?</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Relevant page statistics eg bounce rate, exit rate, drop-off rate.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Observations from clickmaps, heatmaps and scrollmaps.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Segmented view of behaviour on this page (eg new vs returning visitors).</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Observations and anecdotes from usability testing.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Snippets from survey responses.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Quotes from interviews with customer-facing staff such as live chat or customer service.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Test metrics.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="text-fo">Commentators can click on an area of the wireframe to add notes and questions. Everyone sees the other comments and can reply, so you can see the dialogue developing. It is a great way to spark discussion, avoid duplication and have transparency. This also allows you to keep an audit trail of how your first version was influenced by your collaborators&#x2019; comments.</p>
<p class="text"><span id="page-144" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 144. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>When you have a well-oiled process in place, your collaborators will know what is expected. If you are doing this for the first time, send out some instructions with your invitation, so that they know what you want from them. It can also help to manage expectations, as it may not be possible to use everybody&#x2019;s ideas in the final wireframe. Below you can find a sample template:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="block-quote">Dear &#x003C;collaborator&#x2019;s name&#x003E;</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p class="block-quote">We [conducted this research] and [made these observations]. To [solve x problem] for [y users], we&#x2019;ve created this wireframe.</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p class="block-quote">Please could you give me your feedback and ideas. Just log on to &#x003C;noticeboard application&#x003E; to view it and add your comments.</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p class="block-quote">Feel free to be critical &#x2013; it will help me enormously. Here are some things to bear in mind when you give your feedback:</p>
</blockquote><ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet">Be specific in your feedback.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Offer suggestions, not only criticisms.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Explain the reasons behind your suggestions.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Think about situations where the proposed approach might not work eg out-of-stock item.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Spot missing information.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Let me know if you have any relevant data that can add a new perspective.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Ask for clarification if anything is not clear.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Reply to requests for clarification if your comments have not been clearly understood.</p></li>
</ul><blockquote>
<p class="block-quote">You can also add drawings and links if that helps. Thanks for your time and suggestions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="text-fo">Of course, you do not have to take on board every suggestion. Incorporate comments that can move you forward into the final version and ignore the rest.</p>
<p class="text">Some software can also be used to evaluate wireframes. Predictive attention mapping tools, such as EyeQuant and Feng-Gui, use an algorithm powered by thousands of previous eye-tracking studies. They predict what the human eye will notice and what is likely to fall outside of the eye path. Use them to ensure that visitors&#x2019; eyes will be drawn to the most relevant part of the proposed wireframe.</p>
<p class="text">Use the comments you receive on the wireframe, as well as the analysis you gather from tools like EyeQuant, to inform and inspire your current thinking and generate further ideas.</p>

<p class="text-fo">Now it&#x2019;s time to ask your developers to implement the test on the experimentation platform.</p>
<p class="text">Some testing platforms offer a drag-and-drop-style visual editor that allows anyone to make changes. Avoid using this as far as possible, limiting it to making small tweaks to static elements.</p>
<p class="text">When a new element is to be created, or if the test involves a partial or complete redesign, a visual designer would have to first create design assets. For simple experiments, visual design should not be required. The development team can use existing cascading style sheets (CSS) to make the variations fit seamlessly into the existing website.</p>
<p class="text">Hand over the wireframe, copy and any design assets along with a link to the live target page or pages. Also give them the following information:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet">A description of the changes that are to be made, with reference to the wireframe(s).</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">An outline of the hypothesis (ie why the changes are being made).</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Any corporate design guidelines, such as fonts, grids or colours.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">The page(s) where changes are to be made, with the URL(s).</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Goals, metrics to be tracked.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Type of device targeted (eg mobile).</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Segment targeted (eg new visitors only).</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Traffic allocation (eg a 50:50 split).</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Any known browser issues that are likely to impact on correct rendering of the variation.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">An explanation (or use-case) of new functionality (eg pop-ups, change in data logic, scraping data from other parts of the site).</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">How exceptions will be handled (eg what happens if the product is out of stock).</p></li>
</ul>

<section aria-labelledby="ch08_h3_004">
<h3 id="ch08_h3_004" class="head-b">Step 4: QA and UAT</h3>
<p class="text-fo">Ask the developers to perform thorough QA, including browser testing, before sending you a preview link to the test. This allows a limited audience &#x2013; only those with the unique preview link &#x2013; to do UAT.</p>
<p class="text"><span id="page-146" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 146. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>UAT is one of your most important tasks, because it&#x2019;s the final filter before a test goes live. Take some time to check that the variation looks and behaves exactly as it should. If the experiment is intended to run across device types, open the preview link on a desktop machine as well as on your phone. Ask colleagues to check it on their different devices and browsers. Try to walk through a few typical use cases, making sure that nothing goes wrong when you click around the site.</p>
<p class="text">If you find anything that looks out of place, or functionality that doesn&#x2019;t operate as expected, take a screenshot of the issue and send it back to the developers with as much information as possible. Explain exactly what the issue is and how they could replicate it as well as details about your desktop/phone and browser.</p>

<h4 id="ch08_boxtitle_002" class="title" epub:type="title"><span class="txt-capitalize"><b>Case Study</b></span> Xero Shoes</h4>
<p class="text-fo">Xero Shoes are unique lightweight and low-profile running sandals. Wearing them is almost like being barefoot. From our research, we knew that customers loved the barefoot feeling, together with having just enough protection against dirt and thorns. The main pre-purchase concern was how comfortable these shoes were, though many reviews raved about comfort.</p>
<p class="text">When we started working with Xero Shoes, they had no product links on the homepage. The top half of the page was dominated by inspirational images that appealed to their target market. Our research showed us that it was difficult for visitors to form an overall view of the various shoes on offer, and the differences between them. Visitors would sometimes return to the homepage to orientate themselves, but the only way to find the relevant information was to visit each product page separately.</p>
<p class="text">Our hypothesis was that showing products on the homepage would send more traffic to the product detail pages, which would lead to an increase in sales. We wanted to infuse the page with value statements that we knew would appeal to prospective customers, like Harry, the persona you met in <a href="11_chapter05.xhtml#ch05_sec_001">Chapter 5</a> (<a href="11_chapter05.xhtml#ch05_fig_003">Figure 5.3</a>). The resultant wireframe is shown in <a href="#ch08_fig_005">Figure 8.5</a>, with the finished design, which yielded a 6.45 per cent increase in RPV, in &#x000A;<a href="#ch08_fig_006">Figure 8.6</a>.</p>

<section aria-labelledby="ch08_h2_004">
<h2 id="ch08_h2_004" class="head-a">Summary</h2>
<p class="text-fo">A hypothesis is a prediction about cause and effect, a prediction that making certain changes will result in a positive outcome. Those changes should be informed by evidence obtained from data, as discussed in <a href="09_chapter03.xhtml#ch03_sec_001">Chapter 3</a>.</p>
<p class="text"><span id="page-149" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 149. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>It must be testable. You should be able to validate or refute it through a controlled online experiment, usually an A/B test.</p>
<p class="text">The purpose of an experiment is to learn something new about your customers, their behaviour and their interaction with your site. The idea is never to &#x2018;prove&#x2019; your point of view or settle arguments. A well-formulated hypothesis helps to set up this mindset.</p>
<p class="text">If the new experience performs better than the existing one, the hypothesis is validated. When the opposite happens, and the test is negative, it is an opportunity to learn by analysing the unexpected behaviour. You can use that new-found insight to develop alternative hypotheses and iterate on the test to get the desired behavioural change.</p>
<p class="text">The changes proposed in the hypothesis are mapped out in a wireframe. It is used to spur discussion and get input from the team, and occasionally, customer feedback.</p>
<p class="text">If necessary, a visual designer creates design assets for new images, icons or redesign. The final wireframe, copy and design assets are given to developers to implement in the testing platform.</p>
<p class="text">Before the experiment can be made live, it is important to do thorough QA and UAT. This will ensure that the test is free of code errors or bugs, and that it behaves as expected.</p>
