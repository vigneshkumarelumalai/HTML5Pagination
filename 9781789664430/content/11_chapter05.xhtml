</header>
<p class="text-fo">Having dug the foundations with behavioural research, the stage is set for the most valuable insight of them all &#x2013; voice of customer (VoC). Listening to the stories behind data will help you understand quantitative and behavioural data better.</p>
<p class="text">&#x2018;Numbers alone won&#x2019;t convince others&#x2019;, Nick Morgan wrote in <i>Harvard Business Review</i>.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" role="doc-noteref" href="#ch05_en1" id="ch05_enx1">1</a></sup> He continued: &#x2018;Good stories&#x2026; are what attach emotions to your argument, prompt people into unconscious decision making, and ultimately move them to action.&#x2019;</p>
<p class="text">VoC is not just shorthand for customer feedback. It has the following attributes:<sup><a href="#ch05_en2" id="ch05_enx2">2</a></sup></p>
<ul class="list-bullet">
<li><p class="list-bullet">detailed set of customer wants and needs, in their own words;</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">organized into a hierarchical structure, from the customer&#x2019;s perspective;</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">prioritized in terms of importance and satisfaction with current alternatives.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="text-fo">Interviewing customers is by far the best method for obtaining VoC insights. In this chapter, we look at this and other mainly qualitative research methods.</p>
<section aria-labelledby="ch05_h2_001">
<h2 id="ch05_h2_001" class="head-a">Interviews</h2>
<p class="text-fo">Arguably one of the most underrated research methods, an interview is a unique opportunity to learn about customer motivation, <b>needs and wants</b>.</p>
<p class="text">The practical importance of this is stressed by the world&#x2019;s greatest car salesperson, Joe Girard, to whom we return in <a href="19_chapter13.xhtml#ch13_sec_001">Chapter 13</a>: &#x2018;The more you understand about their needs and wants, the better equipped you&#x2019;ll be to provide them with the right solution.&#x2019;<sup><a href="#ch05_en3" id="ch05_enx3">3</a></sup></p>
<p class="text">Interviewing is different from moderated usability testing, covered in <a href="10_chapter04.xhtml#ch04_sec_001">Chapter 4</a>, where you also have one-on-one interactions with users. In that <span id="page-75" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 75. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>context it&#x2019;s not about having a conversation with the user. On the contrary, we emphasized that the moderator must stay quiet and give the user space to get on with the task.</p>
<p class="text">Dialogue gives you the ability to explore, clarify and follow up. Interviews will take you down unexpected paths, and often that&#x2019;s exactly where you&#x2019;ll find the best insights.</p>
<p class="text">&#x2018;There are no facts inside the building so get the heck outside,&#x2019; Steve Blank from Stanford University famously said.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" role="doc-noteref" href="#ch05_en4" id="ch05_enx4">4</a></sup> Interviewing someone in person in their own environment is ideal, but it&#x2019;s not always practical. It can be time consuming and expensive, and is not necessary in most cases. Telephone interviews have advantages of scale, efficiency and geographic reach.</p>
<section aria-labelledby="ch05_h3_001">
<h3 id="ch05_h3_001" class="head-b">Customer interviews</h3>
<p class="text-fo">&#x2018;A deep dive into the lives of customers.&#x2019;<sup><a href="#ch05_en5" id="ch05_enx5">5</a></sup> That&#x2019;s how Steve Portigal, author of <i>Interviewing Users: How to</i> <i>uncover compelling insights</i>, describes it.</p>
<p class="text">Only by talking to customers can you truly begin to understand their context, needs, motivations and pain points. No other research method can let you get into the hearts and minds of your customers to the same extent.</p>
<p class="text">Customer research is not about profiling customers; rather it is done to discover what drives behaviour. It&#x2019;s not demographics that makes someone buy. As Clayton Christensen explains: &#x2018;We live our lives in circumstances. During the course of the day, problems arise and we look around to hire products to solve these problems.&#x2019;<sup><a href="#ch05_en6" id="ch05_enx6">6</a></sup></p>
<p class="text">This fresh way of thinking is the essence of the Jobs To Be Done (JTBD) framework. In their daily lives, people are trying to get stuff done. In doing so, the overall experience is an important consideration. And their circumstances dictate the purchase decision more than customer traits or product attributes.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" role="doc-noteref" href="#ch05_en7" id="ch05_enx7">7</a></sup></p>
<p class="text">Use interviews to uncover the core motivation behind the purchase decision, by understanding what &#x2018;job&#x2019; they are trying to get done. It&#x2019;s not always <b>functional</b>. Your customer might buy an expensive piece of furniture to make a statement in their home (<b>emotional</b> driver). Or buy fashionable sneakers to fit in with the crowd (<b>social</b> driver).</p>
<p class="text">&#x2018;What should I ask?&#x2019; &#x2018;That&#x2019;s the wrong question,&#x2019; an academic tells her students whenever they want to know what questions to ask. &#x2018;You have to have a question that you are really interested in. Not make it up, but find out what you are really interested in.&#x2019;<sup><a href="#ch05_en8" id="ch05_enx8">8</a></sup></p>
<p class="text"><span id="page-76" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 76. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>In <i>The PDMA Handbook</i>, VoC is said to be best explored with indirect questions, grounded in reality.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" role="doc-noteref" href="#ch05_en9" id="ch05_enx9">9</a></sup> Let&#x2019;s explore what is meant by that.</p>
<p class="text"><b>Ground it in reality.</b> Let them talk about past experiences, rather than asking about hypothetical scenarios.</p>
<p class="text">Customers are not good at telling us what they want. Henry Ford is quoted as saying: &#x2018;If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said a faster horse.&#x2019; There is no evidence that he actually said it,<sup><a href="#ch05_en10" id="ch05_enx10">10</a></sup> but it underscores the point that people can&#x2019;t tell you what they want. So don&#x2019;t ask them that. They are much better at telling you about their needs, the problems they are trying to solve and their frustrations in doing so. It&#x2019;s your job to figure out a solution once you have all the relevant information about what causes the problem in the first place.</p>
<p class="text">The best questions begin something like this: &#x2018;Tell me about the last time you&#x2026;.&#x2019; This line of questioning will take you down a path of discovery where you can learn about relevant circumstances, needs, wants, motivational forces and frustrations. The response is based on an actual experience, not predictions relating to some hypothetical scenario.</p>
<p class="text"><b>Ask indirect questions.</b> Avoid starting off with direct questions like &#x2018;what do you want?&#x2019; Ask about current behavioural patterns, solutions and frustrations.</p>
<p class="text">When we worked with a large gardening and plant retailer, some of the questions we asked target customers were:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet">When you last purchased plants, where did you buy them?</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">What alternatives did you consider?</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Why did you buy from that particular outlet on that occasion?</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">How did you decide which plants to purchase?</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Tell us about the last time you bought plants online.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="text-fo">It&#x2019;s best to go into interviews with a handful of seed questions, rather than a complete list to work through. This method, called a <b>semi-structured</b> interview, will allow the conversation to unfold naturally.</p>
<p class="text">What may not be clear at this point is that the insights come from the open response, including side paths and tangents. In fact, it&#x2019;s a good idea to leave a few moments of silence before following up, in case the interviewee wants to fill that space. The real nuggets are often hidden in tangents and extended responses. Without asking directly what their frustrations are, these will soon come out in the detail around decisions made and real experiences.</p>
<p class="text"><span id="page-77" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 77. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>Even a broad and seemingly vague opening question like &#x2018;what do you like about gardening?&#x2019; invites the customer to share underlying needs. In this case, the drivers were more social and emotional than functional. For many, gardening is an escape as well as a way to connect with others. This leads to a particular way of buying flowers and plants. If you understand that journey, you can optimize it.</p>

<h3 id="ch05_h3_002" class="head-b">Customer service representatives</h3>
<p class="text-fo">The operators in the inbound call centre, if you have one, have the thankless task of listening to people moan at them every day. What a gold mine! If you don&#x2019;t have a call centre, speak to colleagues who deal with those customer calls.</p>
<p class="text">Ask them to identify the three to five top queries and complaints. What goes wrong before an order is placed? What information do they want? What do online customers ask about? Why have they contacted the call centre, rather than look at the online help section?</p>
<p class="text">And here is the secret sauce: also ask these colleagues how they respond, and what reaction they get. What do they say that melts away the anxieties and sales objections? Which themes do customers respond well to, and less so?</p>
<p class="text">Tapping into that knowledge can inform a lot of test ideas. One of our clients makes a habit of spending a day in their call centre from time to time. She emerges full of ideas, entirely focused on the customer&#x2019;s agenda.</p>

<section aria-labelledby="ch05_h3_003">
<h3 id="ch05_h3_003" class="head-b">Store managers and salespeople</h3>
<p class="text-fo">If you operate in an omnichannel environment, do yourself a favour and go hang out in your bricks and mortar stores. Shop assistants are at the sharp end of dealing with customers. They get real-time feedback and adjust their sales messages accordingly. They are in the incredibly privileged position of seeing how the purchase decision unfolds, hearing the burning questions and sales objections, and learning which responses push undecided shoppers over the purchase line.</p>
<p class="text">I visited a client&#x2019;s store to look at a high-ticket item that was a big seller, but suffered a high abandonment rate on their site. Seeing how the assistant &#x2018;sold&#x2019; me was an eye-opener, not only for me, but also for the client&#x2019;s online team when I later presented this to them. The pitch was completely different from the online approach. That salesperson knew from talking to hundreds of customers how to pinpoint my needs, and which buttons to push to help my make up my mind.</p>
<p class="text"><span id="page-78" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 78. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>Most omnichannel stores will have Click and Collect counters. This is where your online customers interface with the business in the real world. What can the staff behind that counter share with you? What are their observations of your customers?</p>

<section aria-labelledby="ch05_h2_002">
<h2 id="ch05_h2_002" class="head-a">E-mail surveys</h2>
<p class="text-fo">An e-mail survey is easy to launch and can generate a large number of responses. That makes it one of the most effective methods for gathering customer feedback and data across a broad spectrum.</p>
<p class="text">This low barrier also has a downside. It&#x2019;s easy to get carried away with a long list of questions dumped into SurveyMonkey. We see too much of this survey spam. Before writing your first survey question, have a plan.</p>
<p class="text"><b>What do you need to find out?</b> What is the main purpose of your survey? That will inform what questions to ask. Here are some of the topics you can explore via e-mail surveys:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet">Sentiment &#x2013; what do people say and feel?</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Who are your customers? Are they who you think they are?</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">How are loyal customers different from one-time buyers?</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">What has caused lapsed customers to stop buying from you?</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Who are your key competitors? Are they who you think they are?</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">What do your customers like about your competitors?</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">What do your customers value about your business/product?</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">What is their motivation to buy your products, regardless of where they buy them?</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">How do they make the purchase decision?</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Post-purchase satisfaction (overall, product, service etc).</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Long-term satisfaction.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="text-fo"><b>Don&#x2019;t ask it just because you can!</b> Every question has to have a reason for being there. For each question, you should be able to state in advance how you will act on the data. If you can&#x2019;t do anything with that feedback, don&#x2019;t ask the question.</p>
<p class="text"><b>Target the right audience.</b> Who to send the survey to depends on the research objectives. Are you targeting customers, non-customers or both? <span id="page-79" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 79. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>First-time buyers, one-time buyers or loyal customers? Customers who made a purchase recently or lapsed? Customers who bought particular product categories?</p>
<p class="text"><b>Keep it short.</b> Limit both the number and length of questions. Before you send it out, test how long it takes someone to complete it. Try to keep it around 5&#x2013;10 minutes. Long surveys tend to have lower response rates. The quality of your responses might also suffer as survey fatigue sets it. Give the option to skip questions unless you have a good reason to make it mandatory, such as &#x2018;conditional branching questions&#x2019; where you need a response in order to channel the respondent down the appropriate path.</p>
<p class="text"><b>Ask clear questions.</b> Avoid using technical, marketing and business jargon. Customer-friendly language, not corporate gobbledygook. Don&#x2019;t assume that users will understand your terminology. Avoid using stilted and formal phrasing. Just ask the question how you would ask a friend. Let customer interviews inspire your survey language. Use the same terms and descriptions that you heard from interviewees. Before launching the survey, ask a few colleagues if they understand the questions.</p>
<p class="text"><b>Incentivize responses.</b> Offering a small incentive increases the likelihood that people will take part. This could be important if you have a small database, or if your network is known to be unresponsive. A gift voucher is always popular, but entry into a prize draw can also be used. Although purists say this affects the results, it is certainly preferable to having too little or no data to work on. It&#x2019;s also fair to offer people something for their time and input.</p>
<section aria-labelledby="ch05_h3_004">
<h3 id="ch05_h3_004" class="head-b">Open questions</h3>
<p class="text-fo">There is no doubt that open questions and open-text responses are more valuable, though they also take more time to process. These are questions where a more considered response is required, and can&#x2019;t be answered with one word like &#x2018;yes&#x2019; or &#x2018;no&#x2019;.</p>
<p class="text">You will benefit from seeing the respondent&#x2019;s own words. Sometimes the way in which something is expressed, or the specific words chosen, is as important as what is being said. This is lost when respondents are given answers to choose from.</p>
<p class="text">These responses can also help you later on with creative work, because the actual quotes can be valuable to inform copy, and may even end up being used semi-verbatim in copy or headlines. Column D in <a id="rch05_tab_001" href="#ch05_tab_001">Table 5.1</a> is used for the purpose of creating an &#x2018;ordinary person&#x2019; vocabulary, as opposed to marketing speak.

<p id="ch05_skiptab_001" class="text-fo">Nothing beats reading through user feedback, line by line. That&#x2019;s the point of it, and it&#x2019;s another good reason to limit the number of questions. As the UX researcher Chrissie Brodigan said: &#x2018;No amount of machine learning or text analysis can surface the insights reading open text does.&#x2019;<sup><a href="#ch05_en11" id="ch05_enx11">11</a></sup></p>
<p class="text">Export responses to a spreadsheet and highlight the ones that stand out. Use a colour coding system such as red for high severity, yellow for interesting or noteworthy and green for positive.</p>
<p class="text">Although primarily a qualitative research technique, it&#x2019;s necessary to apply some quantification to open question analysis, as explained later. Categorize each response according to its high-level theme, then count the number of instances per theme. This makes it easier to observe patterns.</p>

<h3 id="ch05_h3_005" class="head-b">Closed questions</h3>
<p class="text-fo">Closed questions give respondents answers to choose from. Make sure that you cover the entire range of possible answers. The best way to do this is by including options for &#x2018;other, please specify&#x2019; and even &#x2018;don&#x2019;t know&#x2019; or &#x2018;not sure&#x2019;.</p>
<p class="text">These questions are easier to process quantitatively, but you don&#x2019;t get the real VoC benefit. Where relevant, follow up with an open question. If <span id="page-81" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 81. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>someone responds to that first closed question, they are generally more likely to provide a follow-up response too.</p>
<p class="text">A big advantage of closed questions is <b>conditional branching</b>. This is where the direction of the survey changes, depending on the response.

How are customers talking about value? What do they find appealing, what do they rave about? What are the positive points that you could possibly amplify?

<h2 id="ch05_h2_004" class="head-a">On-site polls</h2>
<p class="text-fo">The best time to get qualitative insights from your users about the online experience is when they are still in that experience. On-site polls and surveys allow your visitors to give real-time feedback, directly from a page. It&#x2019;s especially useful in situations where you want to examine observed on-site behaviour (<a id="rch05_fig_001" href="#ch05_fig_001">Figure 5.1</a>).</p>

</figure>
<p class="text-fo">For example, a particular handbag product detail page on a client&#x2019;s site was able to draw in the crowds, but battled to turn it into sales. Targeting only those visitors who looked like they were leaving the site from this page, we asked bluntly: &#x2018;Why did you not purchase this handbag?&#x2019; A few comments suggested that they were not sure what to match the handbag with. It was an insight that we could act on, and not even close to what we had anticipated.</p>
<p class="text">Lock onto the problem by targeting your questions as precisely as possible. Is a particular product category performing below average? Ask users on those pages what&#x2019;s missing or why they won&#x2019;t buy. High basket abandonment rate? Ask abandoners why they&#x2019;re leaving. Mobile site not converting? Target mobile visitors to understand their context better. If you have identified sources of anxiety or friction through heuristic evaluation or another method, this is a good way to validate and explore it.</p>
<p class="text">In our experience, most users respond favourably to one or two well-placed polls as it gives them an opportunity to raise any feedback they may have. But it can be annoying if done too aggressively. Use it sparingly to fill specific gaps in your knowledge of customers and their behaviour. Limit the number of surveys and questions that a user will see.</p>
<p class="text">As always, the questions you should ask depend on what you are hoping to find out. Identify the gaps in your knowledge before popping the question. Here are some starters:</p>

<h2 id="ch05_h2_005" class="head-a">NPS survey</h2>
<p class="text-fo">Net Promoter Score (NPS) has been endorsed by <i>Harvard Business Review</i>, calling it the best predictor of loyalty and growth.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" role="doc-noteref" href="#ch05_en12" id="ch05_enx12">12</a></sup> In the context of optimization, NPS offers limited value. It fails to give you anything specific to act on that is measurable in the short term. A simple tweak fixes that.</p>
<p class="text">NPS poses this question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="block-quote">How likely are you to recommend our company to a friend or colleague?</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="text-fo">Users are asked to choose a response on a scale from 0 to 10. To calculate your NPS, subtract the number of detractors (0&#x2013;6) from promoters (9 and 10). Tools like Qualaroo handle this automatically.</p>
<p class="text">To make it more actionable, ask a follow-up question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="block-quote">What is the reason for your response?</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="text-fo">Using pivot tables in Excel or Google Sheets, you can easily map these reasons to the numerical rating the respondent provided. Look carefully at the issues raised by detractors.

<section aria-labelledby="ch05_h2_006">
<h2 id="ch05_h2_006" class="head-a">Value proposition</h2>
<p class="text-fo">One of the primary objectives with VoC analysis is understanding your value proposition. It may surprise you to hear that this is not brainstormed in a boardroom, but co-created with customers.</p>
<p class="text">An enormous body of research points to a link between a well-developed value proposition and business success.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" role="doc-noteref" href="#ch05_en13" id="ch05_enx13">13</a></sup> Without a compelling value proposition, the visitor may not convert even if they came to your site with a strong motivation to buy. MECLABS deems it to be &#x2018;a major key to conversions&#x2019;;<sup><a href="#ch05_en14" id="ch05_enx14">14</a></sup> Widerfunnel goes further: &#x2018;Your value proposition determines your potential conversion rate.&#x2019;<sup><a href="#ch05_en15" id="ch05_enx15">15</a></sup></p>
<p class="text">Unfortunately, the true ethos of the concept has been diluted over the years. It&#x2019;s often confused with the USP (unique selling proposition), but it&#x2019;s not the same thing.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" role="doc-noteref" href="#ch05_en16" id="ch05_enx16">16</a></sup> Neither is it those boxes dotted around the site, shouting &#x2018;Free delivery&#x2019; and &#x2018;Money back guarantee&#x2019;. Michael Lanning, a former McKinsey consultant who first coined the term, laments: &#x2018;Often, the term &#x201C;value proposition&#x201D; has been misinterpreted as the simplistic marketing notion of positioning, the meagre content of which is largely antithetical to the term&#x2019;s true meaning.&#x2019;<sup><a href="#ch05_en17" id="ch05_enx17">17</a></sup></p>
<section aria-labelledby="ch05_h3_009">
<h3 id="ch05_h3_009" class="head-b">What is the value proposition?</h3>
<p class="text-fo">Let&#x2019;s start with a definition of value:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="block-quote">Value = Perceived benefits &#x2212; Perceived cost</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="text-fo">Note that we are dealing with perception. Value is what your customer thinks and believes. If you can shape that perception, you can alter that constructed reality and tip this value equation in your favour. The more you increase perceived benefits and decrease perceived cost, the more likely a sufficiently motivated visitor is to purchase. This is what you can do:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet">Amplify perceived benefits in your messaging.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Make sure these benefits resonate with your customers, by checking directly with them what matters.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet"><span id="page-88" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 88. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>Reduce perceived cost, which is not the same as lowering price.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="text-fo">The value proposition is your promise to customers of how you intend to deliver this value to them. Essentially, it is the answer to this question: &#x2018;Why should I buy from you as opposed to your competitor?&#x2019; If you can write down an answer to that question, you&#x2019;re in a good place. But not so fast; your answer has to pass these filters:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet"><b>WIIFM</b> (What&#x2019;s In It For Me)? It must matter to your customer, which is not the same as what matters to you. To be sure, you have to validate any core assumptions about this &#x2013; you&#x2019;ll see how in later chapters.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet"><b>Say what?</b> Many supposed value proposition statements are nothing but marketing waffle. If the customer doesn&#x2019;t understand your message, how can they be expected to take action?</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet"><b>So what?</b> Consumers have strong BS-filters. Their default stance is to distrust any sales talk. You have to convince them that you&#x2019;re the real deal. There is more on this later in this section.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section aria-labelledby="ch05_h3_010">
<h3 id="ch05_h3_010" class="head-b">Total net experience</h3>
<p class="text-fo">Benefits relate mainly to products, so it&#x2019;s easy to go into product-centric tunnel vision mode. However, the value proposition encompasses the <i>total experience</i> of the customer. Lanning refers to the value proposition as &#x2018;the entire set of resulting experiences&#x2019; that your customer has by buying from you.</p>
<p class="text">To illustrate: A retailer delivered a box of very expensive wine to a loyal customer. A slightly annoyed lady pondered loudly why her husband kept buying &#x2018;all this wine&#x2019;, when there was nowhere to put any more boxes.</p>
<p class="text">In terms of the value equation, perceived cost for the customer (the wine-buying husband) includes:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet">the price of the item itself, an expensive premium wine;</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">storage challenges;</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">justifying the purchase to his wife.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="text-fo">There&#x2019;s a lot of cost in this transaction (not just monetary), yet overall there must have been sufficient perceived benefit, as that scale tipped in the retailer&#x2019;s favour.</p>
<p class="text">When this customer was interviewed later, it became evident that it was not the <i>wine</i> he was buying. He was buying the net resulting <i>experience</i>, to borrow Lanning&#x2019;s phrase. Despite the price tag, storage problems and nagging wife, he was still one up. How?</p>
<p class="text"><span id="page-89" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 89. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>Only a few cases of this rare wine were available, so first there was the badge of owning something quite exclusive. After reading <a href="19_chapter13.xhtml#ch13_sec_001">Chapter 13</a>, it will be clear to you why. What really sealed the deal, though, was the prospect of sharing it with his dinner guests. Who wouldn&#x2019;t feel special? Who wouldn&#x2019;t be impressed with our customer&#x2019;s taste for the finer things in life? So who are the lucky dinner guests, the interviewer asked. Astoundingly, there was no confirmed dinner date. Such is the power of a compelling value proposition that an imagined event sold an expensive case of wine, which ended up being squeezed into a cupboard by an unimpressed spouse.</p>
</section>
<section aria-labelledby="ch05_h3_011">
<h3 id="ch05_h3_011" class="head-b">Discover your value proposition</h3>
<p class="text-fo"><i>Discover</i> is a deliberate choice of words. Business often talks about <i>determining</i> the value proposition, but it&#x2019;s the wrong mindset. Your value promise does not matter to customers unless it matches <i>their</i> perception of value. Management is unfortunately often out of sync with the reality of their customers. In a study of 326 firms by management consultants Bain &#x0026; Co, 80 per cent believed they were providing a superior customer experience. However, only 8 per cent of their customers thought that was the case!<sup><a href="#ch05_en18" id="ch05_enx18">18</a></sup></p>
<p class="text">Ask your customers what matters to them. Here are a few sample questions, again related to actual experiences instead of hypothetical scenarios:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet">What made you buy from us as opposed to a competitor?</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">What made you buy from a competitor instead of us?</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">What persuaded you to make this purchase?</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">How would you justify the expense to X?</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">How did you think product X would make your life better?</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">How would things be different if you stopped using product X?</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">How would your life change if you no longer had access to product X?</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="text-fo">Here&#x2019;s an exercise you can do today to get a sense of what matters to your customers. Compare the click-through rates (CTR) of paid search campaigns, including ones that have been paused. Divide the headlines and ad content into broad themes. You may end up with categories like price match, free delivery, range, guarantee and so on. Are there any patterns when you compare the CTR performance across these broad categories? Users may consistently respond more favourably to one theme over another.</p>
<p class="text">Also test candidate value propositions using the same method. You have the benefit of far more traffic in search results than you have on your site, and it&#x2019;s a relatively inexpensive way of validating your value proposition. <span id="page-90" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 90. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>Create different text advertisements, each containing a distinct value theme. Then, compare the results over a period of time in the same way, using CTR as a proxy for customer appeal.</p>

<section>
<h4 class="head-c">Clarity</h4>
<p class="text-fo">If the customer doesn&#x2019;t understand your message, how can they ever be expected to act on it? This is not the time for clever word play. Be specific about the benefit they will get, why it matters to them and why they should believe you.</p>
<p class="text">Make it easy for the customer to visualize the post-purchase benefit. Images and sensory language can help us to feel and taste something. When someone is imagining themselves experiencing the benefit of the product, the sale is more likely to happen.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h4 class="head-c">Differentiation</h4>
<p class="text-fo">What is unique about your offer, or what aspect of it is unique? What makes it stand out from the alternatives? How is it better than alternative solutions? Do a competitor analysis (see next section) to identify gaps in the marketing noise that you can exploit.</p>
<p class="text">Remember, for your customer doing nothing is also an option.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" role="doc-noteref" href="#ch05_en20" id="ch05_enx20">20</a></sup> Create the perception of a net resulting experience that overcomes both competitors and consumer inertia.</p>

<p class="text-fo">People are sceptical about marketing messages and &#x2018;sales talk&#x2019;. Your statement needs to have &#x2018;verisimilitude&#x2019; &#x2013; the appearance of truth. Below are mechanisms to improve the credibility of your claims. You&#x2019;ll see some of it put into practice in the value proposition case study:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet">Offer objective support, such as ratings, testimonials and endorsements.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Be specific. For example, &#x2018;2,378 products in stock&#x2019; sounds more credible than &#x2018;we have the largest range&#x2019;.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Use language that resonates with your customers. To achieve this, many copywriters draw inspiration from qualitative customer surveys and interviews. They may even quote specific phrases used by customers.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Connect with a persona. Know your customers; create your value messages for one person that represents a dominant segment. This is covered in detail at the end of this chapter.</p></li>

<p class="text-fo">This case study shows a compelling value proposition, forcefully communicated on an e-commerce site, for the UK&#x2019;s largest retailer of specialist toys and food for exotic birds.</p>
<p class="text">Heather is a widow in her late 60s, living in the north of England. Her parrot is more than a pet &#x2013; he&#x2019;s a companion, a child (&#x2018;perpetual toddler&#x2019; in her words). She is the persona around whom this page was developed.</p>
<p class="text"><span id="page-92" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 92. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>You&#x2019;ll never hear Heather refer to &#x2018;my parrot&#x2019; &#x2013; only by his name, Buddy. She loves buying nice things for him, but is always concerned about his safety, as toys that come apart from rough parrot play can cause injury. She heard about Northern Parrots from another parrot owner, who had been recommended by her vet.</p>
<p class="text">From surveys and interviews, we knew what customers valued. We changed the homepage, Heather&#x2019;s entry point, replacing the hero image at the top of the page with messaging that reflected those insights:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet">Trusted shop, recommended by veterinarians &#x2013; so your parrot is safe.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Widest range of things for your parrot &#x2013; so your parrot can have fun, playing with something new.</p></li>

<p class="text-fo">Don&#x2019;t confuse this with copying competitors, which is unfortunately all too common.

<p id="ch05_skiptab_002" class="text-fo">The missing perspective here is what actually matters to your customers. That insight will come from other data sources, such as surveys. When you have that information, you can use the two data sets to fine-tune your sales conversation and value proposition. Is there anything your users rated that is drowned in white noise? Is there any space in the landscape of messages that you can own? The biggest opportunity is a theme your customers care about a lot, but doesn&#x2019;t feature highly in competitor messaging.</p>
<p class="text">Finally, it can be interesting to do usability testing on your competition. See <a href="10_chapter04.xhtml#ch04_sec_001">Chapter 4</a> for details. This will let you see their offer and journey through the eyes of your customers. As we&#x2019;ve said, just don&#x2019;t fall into the trap of wanting to copy them.</p>

<h2 id="ch05_h2_008" class="head-a">Put it all together in personas</h2>
<p class="text-fo">Meetings at Amazon always have an extra seat, empty and reserved for The Customer.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" role="doc-noteref" href="#ch05_en22" id="ch05_enx22">22</a></sup> It&#x2019;s a reminder to everyone that the customer&#x2019;s voice should be present.</p>
<p class="text">It&#x2019;s easy to lose sight of the fact that behind all the data you have collected are real people &#x2013; your site visitors and customers. Yet, anything that appears on a web page is ultimately there to try to get human beings to take a certain action. In this chapter we have looked at ways to understand who those people are. What are their interests, needs and pain points? What motivates them to buy?</p>
<p class="text">Personas can help you to package all of these data meaningfully. A persona is a character who represents an archetypal user. Though fictional, they are firmly based on data and grounded in reality. Personas remind you that you are not optimizing for yourself, but for a user. You are not your user. Your boss is not your user. The UX consultant is not your user.</p>
<p class="text">Personas also serve as a reminder that not all your customers are the same. There is a small risk in optimizing your site for the <i>average user</i>, but such a thing doesn&#x2019;t exist. As the <i>Wizard of Ads</i> author, Roy H Williams, said: &#x2018;Your business has only 3 or 4 customers living at thousands of different addresses.&#x2019;<sup><a href="#ch05_en23" id="ch05_enx23">23</a></sup></p>
<p class="text">Some practitioners write personas off as a bit woolly, and Jason Fried of 37signals may have spoken on behalf of many others when he dismissed personas as &#x2018;artificial, abstract, and fictitious&#x2019;.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" role="doc-noteref" href="#ch05_en24" id="ch05_enx24">24</a></sup> Indeed, if your personas are formulated in a brainstorming session, without much user data, they&#x2019;re pointless. However, if you base them on actual people, if they are informed by research, they are actually immensely useful. One study claimed that the use of personas led to superior user experience in design.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" role="doc-noteref" href="#ch05_en25" id="ch05_enx25">25</a></sup></p>
<p class="text"><span id="page-95" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 95. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>A strong argument in favour of personas came from an interaction designer, who used to view the practice with &#x2018;disdain&#x2019;. Later, he became an advocate. Explaining this twist in <i>Smashing Magazine</i>, he writes: &#x2018;My process became more efficient and fun, while the fruits of my labor became more impactful and useful to others. Never before had I seen such a boost in clarity, productivity and success in my own work.&#x2019;<sup><a href="#ch05_en26" id="ch05_enx26">26</a></sup> When you create a wireframe with one person in mind, or when you rewrite a product description to talk directly to that person, it brings clarity and focus.</p>
<p class="text">One of our clients has three personas &#x2013; expectant parents, parents and gifters. We called one Julia, based on real interviews conducted with mothers of young babies. In the early hours of the morning, in a quiet part of the house away from the rest of the family, she is feeding her baby. Julia is inspired by several customers who described to us how they would start browsing our client&#x2019;s mobile site, making mental notes of things to come back to later. Do you think that a wireframe designed with her in mind looks different from one without this vision of Julia? Absolutely.</p>
<section aria-labelledby="ch05_h3_014">
<h3 id="ch05_h3_014" class="head-b">What does a persona look like?</h3>
<p class="text-fo">The essence of persona creation is described by Alan Cooper, a pioneer of the method: &#x2018;Develop a precise description of your user and what they wish to accomplish.&#x2019;<sup><a href="#ch05_en27" id="ch05_enx27">27</a></sup> Fundamentally, that boils down to two things: a biography of sorts plus a goal statement.</p>
<p class="text">Cooper emphasized that <b>goals</b> and personas are two sides of the same coin. It&#x2019;s easy to fall into the trap of focusing too much on the person and not enough on goals. Make it your number one priority to understand what each persona wants to achieve, what their needs are, what problem they are trying to solve. That becomes the distinguishing attribute that sets one persona apart from another.</p>
<p class="text">Some find it useful to adopt the mindset of JTBD, the framework mentioned earlier in this chapter. What is the &#x2018;job&#x2019; that your customer wants to get done &#x2013; functional, social and/or emotional? How does &#x2018;hiring&#x2019; your product help them get this job done?<sup><a href="#ch05_en28" id="ch05_enx28">28</a></sup> The aim is to think about your user&#x2019;s core goal, which might be something like:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet">Impress guests with exclusive, expensive wine.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Encourage young child to read by buying story books.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Let my wife know I&#x2019;m thinking of her by sending her some flowers.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="text-fo"><span id="page-96" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 96. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>Another component of personas is scenarios: stories that outline the sequence of activities carried out by the user to achieve this goal.</p>
<p class="text">The biographical content varies depending on your context. Unless demographics are central to your business model, it doesn&#x2019;t take centre stage in your personas. As we said earlier, it&#x2019;s not demographics that drive behaviour. Don&#x2019;t neglect it though, as it serves to complete the narrative and make the persona real and memorable. For the same reason, your persona should be polished with a name and, preferably, even a face (<a id="rch05_fig_003" href="#ch05_fig_003">Figure 5.3</a>).</p>

<h3 id="ch05_h3_015" class="head-b">How to create personas</h3>
<p class="text-fo">Whatever you do, don&#x2019;t brainstorm them from your own assumptions about users. Useful personas are not fabricated, but discovered through analysis. A strong research bedrock is what makes them credible. Brainstorming can be a starting point, what is known as a proto-persona, but these personas must be validated with actual data and adjusted as necessary.</p>
<p class="text"><span id="page-97" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 97. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>A great first step in building personas is to run a dedicated e-mail survey. Collect demographic details, but focus on core motivations. What do they want to achieve by visiting your site or buying your product? What alternatives do they explore? How, in specific terms, is your offer better for them than the alternatives? When you have enough responses, look for patterns of difference and similarity. That will be the start of the various persona groupings.</p>
<p class="text">Nothing beats semi-structured interviews for learning about your users&#x2019; needs, goals and motivations. Visiting users at their home or office provides a richer experience, but telephone interviews may be easier and more cost-effective. Allow the conversation to unfold naturally and let the interviewee do most of the talking. Stick to open-ended and indirect questions, asking only one question at a time. Below is a list of sample questions:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet">Context:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet-sub">
<li><p class="list-bullet-sub">Tell us a bit about yourself.</p></li>

<h3 id="ch05_h3_016" class="head-b">How many personas do you need?</h3>
<p class="text-fo">Each persona represents a different customer segment. Segment by goals and behaviour, not demographics.</p>
<p class="text">At first, you won&#x2019;t know what those segments should be. Don&#x2019;t let it distract you. As you speak to customers it will become clear, and you&#x2019;ll see personas taking shape naturally. If you kick-start the process with an internal brainstorm, don&#x2019;t let fictional pen portraits created out of uninformed beliefs stop you putting together well-researched personas. Treat them as hypotheses to be validated with research.</p>
<p class="text">Some experts recommend creating a persona for each segment across the entire spectrum, including ones you don&#x2019;t cater for. That is boiling the ocean in our view. One primary persona, and around three to four secondary personas, should suffice in most cases. The exact number is not important, as long as you have covered the key ones for your situation.</p>
<p class="text">Aim for at least five interviews per persona. In our experience, this is enough to provide depth and colour alongside your quantitative data. As you&#x2019;re gathering the data, start breaking them into themes. Look out for patterns and commonalities that you can base the different personas on.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section aria-labelledby="ch05_h2_009">
<h2 id="ch05_h2_009" class="head-a">Summary</h2>
<p class="text-fo">As important as it is to have the backdrop of behavioural insights, voice-of-customer data is where you&#x2019;ll strike gold. It will give you a new perspective on quantitative and behavioural data.</p>
<p class="text">Steve Blank famously said: &#x2018;There are no facts inside the building so get the heck outside!&#x2019;<sup><a href="#ch05_en29" id="ch05_enx29">29</a></sup></p>
<p class="text">Yet, too often boardrooms are filled with managers who think they can read the minds of their customers, talk on their behalf, make decisions on their behalf.</p>
<p class="text">You are not your customer. Your boss is not your customer. Your marketing agency is not your customer.</p>
<p class="text"><span id="page-100" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 100. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>If you want to serve more customers, and you want to sell more goods to them more frequently, you have to understand their world. What are the driving forces that have them come to you, or go to a competitor?</p>
<p class="text">One of the best ways to find out is to speak to them directly. A customer interview is a rare opportunity to immerse yourself in the world of the customer. Don&#x2019;t ask them for solutions, or try to predict how they would behave under hypothetical conditions. Ask them to talk about actual direct experiences they&#x2019;ve had. Let them talk while you listen actively. From that, you can learn about their needs, motivations and frustrations.</p>
<p class="text">Surveys have the advantage of ease and scale. You can do surveys via e-mail as well as on the website, asking context-sensitive questions in situ. It&#x2019;s a good way to discover what is behind quantitative observations like drop-off rate and cart abandonment. Feedback channels, such as live chat and customer support e-mails, will add more layers of insight.</p>
<p class="text">Your value proposition can be summarized as the answer to this question: &#x2018;Why should I buy from you as opposed to your competitors?&#x2019; This should go beyond features and benefits to encompass the entire experience. Your message should deliver a clear promise of value, balancing perceived benefits and perceived cost.</p>
<p class="text">The value proposition will have to compete with claims made by competitors, so conduct a competitive analysis to be aware of that context. Audit core themes that your users are exposed to, and make a judgement on how you fit in with that.</p>
<p class="text">Personas are controversial because too often they are not real, but based on guesses and intuition. Think of it as a way to package all your insights about customers. Personas are valuable if they are grounded in research and analysis.</p>
<p class="text">Wireframes, A/B test variations and sales copy are more likely to resonate with customers if they were created with them in mind. Properly formed personas give them a voice in the optimization process.</p>
