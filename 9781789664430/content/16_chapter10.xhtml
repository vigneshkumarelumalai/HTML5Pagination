<p class="text-fo">Statistician&#x2019;s humour alert: You and I sit at the bar. In walks Bill Gates and joins us for a drink. Our average salary shoots up exponentially.</p>
<p class="text">That is the problem with averages. The average user doesn&#x2019;t exist, and yet our websites are created for them. Even when doing optimization, many of the improvements may be targeting that non-existent average user.</p>
<p class="text">Personalization fixes that by tailoring the experience, based on what we know about a visitor. It is the online equivalent of walking into a hotel, being recognized by the concierge and having the barman ask if you would like the &#x2018;usual&#x2019;.</p>
<p class="text">Adoption of personalization is increasing as tools and resources become more accessible. An impressive 90 per cent of organizations reported uplifts from personalization, with 58 per cent seeing more than 10 per cent in their KPIs.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" role="doc-noteref" href="#ch10_en1" id="ch10_enx1">1</a></sup></p>
<p class="text">The ultimate personalized experience is truly unique to each visitor, but that&#x2019;s not the only approach, or even the best one. You may already have started putting together personas, as recommended in <a href="11_chapter05.xhtml#ch05_sec_001">Chapter 5</a>. That forms the perfect foundation for personalization, because it identifies the most valuable segments based on shared characteristics.</p>
<p class="text">Personalization is not a substitute for optimization; it is part of it. That said, data requirements and resourcing needs are more demanding, and execution has proved to be tough for some. If you&#x2019;re just starting out with experimentation, personalization is perhaps a distraction. If you&#x2019;re already enjoying the fruits of an active testing roadmap, personalization is the next step in the evolution of your programme.</p>
<section aria-labelledby="ch10_h2_001">
<h2 id="ch10_h2_001" class="head-a">Data and segments</h2>
<p class="text-fo">Data are the backbone of personalization campaigns. To give your visitors a tailored experience, you act on what you know about them. So before you can do any form of personalization, you have to put measures in place to start collecting relevant data. Useful types of information include:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet">
<li><p class="list-bullet"><span id="page-187" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 187. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>Declared or discovered preferences</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Demographics</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Behaviour</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Context.</p></li></ul>
<p class="text-fo">Data allow you to split the audience into various <b>segments</b>. The data can be collected in a number of ways. On one side of the spectrum, it can be fully automated, with advanced algorithms constantly digging for segments. Specialist personalization platforms employ machine learning and predictive modelling to do that. It&#x2019;s more common, however, to create segments manually, especially in the beginning.</p>
<p class="text">Some information can be obtained directly from the user through surveys, and through self-selection mechanisms on the site. We worked with a specialist retailer of baby goods, who had identified three broad personas &#x2013; expectant parents, parents and gifters. Each one had different needs. First-time visitors to the site were presented with a box, giving them the option to self-select one of these segments. That information was then stored in a cookie against their profile, along with other data. Over time, the journey and experience of those users would become increasingly targeted and relevant.</p>
<p class="text">Not all personalization data are linked directly to the individual; relevance also depends on their context. This includes information such as where they are (country, region, town, on the move, in the store etc), what device they are using, time of day and even the weather in their current location.</p>
<p class="text">Where data are linked to an individual, they can be classified into <i>who</i> they are and <i>what</i> they do, as well as whether they are anonymous or identified:</p>
<ul class="list"><li><p class="list"><b>Anonymous</b>: The information stored is either cookie based or session based. For example, is it a new or returning visitor (who)? Which product or category have they visited (what)? Since the data are anonymous, this is useful for building segments.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><b>Identified</b>: This can be information they have given you, or that you know about them from other data sources. It might include their name and demographics (who), and previous purchase history (what). This can be used for hyper-personalized campaigns, tied back to the individual visitor.</p></li>

<p id="ch10_tabskip_001" class="text-fo">Research by Econsultancy revealed that organizations are using mainly the following data sources for personalization, in order of popularity:<sup><a href="#ch10_en2" id="ch10_enx2">2</a></sup></p>
<ul class="list-bullet">
<li><p class="list-bullet">Pages and categories visited</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Transaction data</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Products browsed</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Geographic information</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Demographics</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Customer engagement</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Acquisition channel</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Contextual (device, weather etc)</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">RFM (recency, frequency, monetary)</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Preferences, interests, hobbies.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="text-fo">One of the best-known examples of personalization is a product recommendation engine (PRE). These are algorithms to generate suggestions when a visitor is looking at a product. They show up on the site as images and messages such as &#x2018;People who bought this also bought that&#x2019;.</p>
<p class="text"><span id="page-189" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 189. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>PREs can also be used to give the customer recommendations based on what they have bought in the past, to the extent of creating a personalized homepage for them based on previous buying behaviour.</p>
<p class="text">You can develop a PRE yourself or use one of the many commercially available engines from companies like Rich Relevance, Attraqt, Peerius and Barilliance. In 2012 Amazon reported a 29 per cent increase in sales after introducing their own recommendation system.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" role="doc-noteref" href="#ch10_en3" id="ch10_enx3">3</a></sup></p>
<p class="text">To offer deeply personalized experiences requires investment in a personalization platform that can drill down to the level of the individual, marrying its own behavioural data layer with contextual and external data sources.</p>
<p class="text">These experiments tend to be harder and more expensive to implement.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" role="doc-noteref" href="#ch10_en4" id="ch10_enx4">4</a></sup> Not only do they require sophisticated technology, but they also need considerable thought about the data layer&#x2019;s components and how the algorithm will work to ensure that the correct experiment is served to the right individual. Companies like Qubit, Optimizely, Monetate, Maxymiser and Insider GMP offer advanced personalization capabilities that make this more accessible.</p>
<p class="text">However, there are other ways to do personalization, without the use of complex algorithms and expensive technology. Here are some examples.</p>
<section aria-labelledby="ch10_h3_001">
<h3 id="ch10_h3_001" class="head-b">Location targeting</h3>
<p class="text-fo">Some sites have reported an uplift in sales by showing images of local landmarks on their homepage, such as the Eiffel Tower for users in Paris and the Statue of Liberty for users in New York.</p>
<p class="text">Taking it one step further, it is possible to incorporate the weather in the visitor&#x2019;s location. Leading men&#x2019;s clothing retailer, Burton, used this technique on their homepage by showing a different image whenever the temperature dropped below a certain level (<a id="rch10_fig_001" href="#ch10_fig_001">Figure 10.1</a>). A selection of warm clothing would appear alongside the symbol for snow as well as the name of the town and the local temperature.</p>

<h2 id="ch10_h2_002" class="head-a">When to do personalization</h2>
<p class="text-fo">Success stories like these mean that many companies are keen to do personalization, and there is now a host of technologies available to do this quickly and cheaply. Here are three indicators that tell you when to put personalization high up on your shortlist of opportunities:</p>
<ol class="list-number"><li><p class="list-number"><b><span id="page-191" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 191. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>Research uncovers segmentation opportunities</b>: You discover that there are one or more valuable segments, or they seem to behave in a significantly different way, or they are underperforming.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number"><b>Experimentation reveals segmentation opportunities</b>: Post-test analysis reveals markedly different results among different visitor segments.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number"><b>Results from A/B tests start to plateau</b>: Optimization is geared towards increasing sales for all visitors, so in a sense you are always optimizing for the &#x2018;average visitor&#x2019;. This one-size-fits-all approach does the job very well, but there may come a time when personalization is the logical next step.</p></li>
</ol>
<section aria-labelledby="ch10_h3_003">
<h3 id="ch10_h3_003" class="head-b">Indicator 1: Research-led segmentation opportunities</h3>
<p class="text-fo">Imagine you discover that a high proportion of first-time visitors are unfamiliar with your brand and have some concerns about your products. Many of these first-time visitors land on your homepage. From this insight you might hypothesize that you need to give new visitors a personalized experience to educate them and reassure them.</p>
<p class="text">Your chosen creative solution is to show a video of your CEO talking about why they started the business, the customer problems they wanted to solve, and interviews with the committed customer service team. The video has been specifically made to allay fears and increase trust in your brand. This is an example of where you have discovered a personalization opportunity through research.</p>
</section>
<section aria-labelledby="ch10_h3_004">
<h3 id="ch10_h3_004" class="head-b">Indicator 2: Experiment-led segmentation opportunities</h3>
<p class="text-fo">Post-test segmentation lets you examine how different segments reacted differently to changes introduced in a test. Integrate GA with the test to identify segments that might respond to a personalized approach.</p>
<p class="text">For established enterprises a substantial segment could represent just 5 per cent of your revenue; if you are a start-up it could be as high as 75 per cent of your revenue.</p>
<p class="text">To show you how this works, <a id="rch10_tab_002" href="#ch10_tab_002">Table 10.2</a> shows test data around all visitors, not just a segment. Say the hypothesis was related to the product detail page, and the experiment tested a revised layout. Separately, you have calculated the size of your segments for both new and returning visitors and are aware that both are substantial.</p>

The revenue uplift from new visitors who saw the experiment was much higher than from returning visitors. Armed with this knowledge, it may well be worth creating a personalized experience just for new visitors.</p>
</section>
<section aria-labelledby="ch10_h3_005">
<h3 id="ch10_h3_005" class="head-b">Indicator 3: Revitalizing a plateauing testing programme</h3>
<p class="text-fo">When you reach the point where optimizing for the average visitor is becoming less effective, personalization could get you good uplifts once again. As always, it&#x2019;s preferable that your experiments are grounded in objective research and analysis.</p>
<section>
<h4 class="head-c">Designing a personalized experience</h4>
<p class="text-fo">The creative possibilities are endless and the technology to make it happen gets cheaper and easier all the time. There are a huge number of solutions, so your biggest problem could be not the mechanics of personalization but deciding what unique experience to offer visitors.</p>
<p class="text">Before you invest a lot of time and effort in a personalization programme, bring some clarity to your decision making by asking yourself these three questions:<sup><a href="#ch10_en5" id="ch10_enx5">5</a></sup></p>
<ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet">Who will see the experiment?</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">What are they going to see?</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Where in the journey will they see it?</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="text-fo"><span id="page-193" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 193. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>In the scenario above, where you have created a video especially for new visitors, the answer to the three W questions would be:</p>
<ul class="list"><li><p class="list">Q. Who is going to see this experiment?</p></li>
<li><p class="list">A. New visitors</p></li>
<li><p class="list">Q. What are they going to see?</p></li>
<li><p class="list">A. A video about your business and your commitment to customer service</p></li>
<li><p class="list">Q. Where in the visitor journey is this going to be shown?</p></li>
<li><p class="list">A. At the beginning, on the homepage</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="text-fo">If you can give clear, satisfactory answers to all three W questions, there is a good chance that a personalized experience will have a positive impact and improve your website.</p>

<h2 id="ch10_h2_003" class="head-a">Technical options for personalization</h2>
<p class="text-fo">Of companies doing personalization, 61 per cent are using their A/B testing tools and only 27 per cent are using a specialist personalization platform.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" role="doc-noteref" href="#ch10_en6" id="ch10_enx6">6</a></sup></p>
<p class="text"><b>Existing experimentation platform</b>: Choose from native segments in the platform, or create custom segments by planting cookies. For a high street retailer, we ran an experiment targeting visitors who had not purchased before. To create this segment, one of the things we did was to set up a campaign registering a visitor once they reached the transaction confirmation page, and let it run for a few months to build the audience. Those visitors were excluded from our test.</p>
<p class="text">Many A/B testing platforms now offer some personalization capabilities, for example Convert, A/B Tasty and VWO.</p>
<p class="text"><b>Specialist personalization platform</b>: For more sophisticated personalization, invest in a dedicated personalization platform. Vendors include Optimizely, Qubit, Maxymiser, Monetate, Adobe and Insider GMP. These platforms will also autosuggest segments for which it may be profitable to run experiments.</p>
<p class="text">Although it is possible to run exciting, highly personalized web experiences, they can be expensive, so have the right resources in place to ensure a return on investment. It may be a good idea to involve a specialist agency in the initial stages, as many vendors have noticed agencies consistently delivering superior results to internal teams.</p>
<p class="text">Our recommended approach is to start with basic personalization, using your current A/B testing platform to build a business case for future investment.</p>

<section aria-labelledby="ch10_h2_004">
<h2 id="ch10_h2_004" class="head-a"><span id="page-194" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 194. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>Personalization vs A/B testing</h2>
<p class="text-fo">There are big similarities between personalization and testing. Both test a hypothesis, which could be validated or refuted. Both involve two versions and, in both, each version is shown to a particular set of users. When the test period has ended, both are reported using a metric such as RPV.</p>
<p class="text">Where personalization experiments are different is when they use a data layer to deliver a bespoke experience borne from information held on that individual. Advanced personalization campaigns are continuously served by the platform, whereas A/B tests are stopped and hard-coded into code base.</p>
<p class="text">The majority of organizations (84 per cent) see an increase in conversion rates when they combine A/B testing with web personalization, according to various research reports.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" role="doc-noteref" href="#ch10_en7" id="ch10_enx7">7</a></sup></p>
</section>
<section aria-labelledby="ch10_h2_005">
<h2 id="ch10_h2_005" class="head-a">Summary</h2>
<p class="text-fo">Personalization is a natural evolution of your website optimization strategy. It offers you the opportunity to make the web experience more relevant to segments of your visitors, even down to individual users.</p>
<p class="text">The more relevant you make the experience, the better your website is able to convert visitors into customers.</p>
<p class="text">Personalization relies on data to define segments. This includes what you know about who your website visitor is, how they behave on your site and their context. Those data can come from various sources, including information provided by the user as well as behavioural information stored in cookies. It&#x2019;s wise to start setting up data channels as early as possible to be ready for personalization in the future.</p>
<p class="text">Many companies have seen healthy uplifts from running simple personalization experiments based on variables such as new and returning visitors, user location and visits to particular product categories. The opportunities can be discovered through research and post-test segmentation, as well as machine learning algorithms.</p>
<p class="text">If you see the results from optimizing your website for all visitors starting to wane, consider using personalization to revitalize your website optimization efforts.</p>
<p class="text">To design and launch a personalized experiment, answer three questions &#x2013; who will see the experiment, what will they see and where in the customer journey will they see it.</p>
<p class="text"><span id="page-195" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 195. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>You can use your A/B testing platform to serve simple personalization experiments. In fact, this is what the majority of companies are doing. Once you want to integrate customer information, external data and machine learning, look at investing in a personalization platform.</p>
