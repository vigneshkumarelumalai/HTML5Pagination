</header>
<p class="text-fo">&#x2018;We need a better website&#x2019; is often where it starts.</p>
<p class="text">Switching to a new website, or migrating to a new e-commerce platform, is likely to be one of the biggest capital expenses any 21st-century online business could make. Typically, it&#x2019;s a huge investment of time, management resources and money.</p>
<p class="text">It&#x2019;s exciting, and naturally comes with high expectations that the effort and expense will be worth it, with improved efficiencies and sales.</p>
<p class="text">All too often though, the reality is somewhat different. Things do go wrong and there are endless ways for the changes to lead to reduced revenue and a poorer customer experience.</p>
<p class="text">What problems are typically encountered? How do you prevent them happening and get the website you&#x2019;re hoping for? And if, despite your best efforts, the website fails to give you higher sales when you launch, what can you do to put it right?</p>
<section aria-labelledby="ch14_h3_001">
<h2 id="ch14_h3_001" class="head-a">Do you need a new website?</h2>
<p class="text-fo">Before you start on a major replatform or redesign, the first question is whether a new website is required in the first place. Have you fully considered the other option of keeping the current site and investing the resources you might have spent on a new website on optimizing it? It&#x2019;s less exciting, but it&#x2019;s a way to de-risk the migration.</p>
<p class="text">A brand new website that replaces your existing one with another, which often bears little resemblance to the old website&#x2019;s look and feel, navigation and/or functionality, is called a &#x2018;radical redesign&#x2019;.</p>
<p class="text">The opposite is &#x2018;evolutionary site redesign&#x2019;, which comes about naturally as part of the experimentation process. Evolutionary site design (ESR) gives you continual improvements and increasing online sales in a controlled way.</p>
<p class="text"><span id="page-232" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 232. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>By contrast, radical redesign is typically undertaken every five years or so, costing large amounts of money and time. The hope is that it will achieve a substantial increase in sales immediately, although this is by no means guaranteed. <a id="rch14_fig_001" href="#ch14_fig_001">Figures 14.1</a> and <a id="rch14_fig_002" href="#ch14_fig_002">14.2</a> illustrate why you make just as much money, if not more, with evolutionary changes, without any of the risks and uncertainties of a brand new expensive design.</p>
<figure class="figure" id="ch14_fig_001"><figcaption>
<p class="figure"><a href="#rch14_fig_001"><span class="label" epub:type="label">Figure</span> <span class="ordinal" epub:type="ordinal">14.1</span> Evolutionary site redesign</a></p>

</figcaption>
<p class="figure-media"><img src="images/M14NF002.jpg" alt="A sample bar graph for radical redesign shows a sharp increase in revenue after redesign."/></p>
</figure>
<p class="text-fo">In ESR, gains are made each year. Any improvements made in Year 1 carry on over the following four years, so revenue growth is cumulative and exponential. To achieve ESR requires a systematic programme of continuous learning, testing and optimization. Since you are verifying each incremental improvement, the extra sales are predictable before they go live on the website.</p>
<p class="text">Radical redesigns are risky. Often there has not been a process of learning and discovery, so revenue uplifts are not as predictable. Second, there is often not a clear line of sight between changes to the website and the result they may generate. As we&#x2019;ve seen in <a href="15_chapter09.xhtml#ch09_sec_001">Chapter 9</a>, this cause and effect can be established by way of running experiments.</p>
<p class="text"> Once the decision to invest in a radical redesign has been taken, there remains a significant question mark as to whether this investment will be <span id="page-233" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 233. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>repaid. Worse, you will only find out after the investment has been made and the new site is live.</p>
<p class="text">While we recommend the evolutionary approach, there may be times when a radical redesign will be justified:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet">The website&#x2019;s underlying technology is severely outdated, eg the website is not responsive or the website has been patched so frequently that simple updates become slow and costly to implement.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">The third party providing website development services on their proprietary platform is slow and expensive and you need to replatform and start a new relationship with a different supplier.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">The overall design of the website is so outdated that it has a negative impact on the standing of the brand.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Results from your optimization efforts show diminishing returns and you have hit your local maxima (first mentioned in <a href="15_chapter09.xhtml#ch09_sec_001">Chapter 9</a>).</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="text-fo">However, almost certainly for you an ESR would be not only possible but desirable. This is the current practice of most of today&#x2019;s internet giants. The likes of Facebook, Google, Amazon and eBay continually evolve their current design and functionality:</p>
<ol class="list-number"><li><p class="list-number"><span id="page-234" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 234. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>Still get the new &#x2018;look and feel&#x2019; and lift conversion at the same time.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number">Get real-time feedback on whether a change is delivering the desired impact or not. If not, you can easily retrace your steps.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number">Focus on key business metrics rather than a design that may look aesthetically pleasing but does not perform or offer a good user experience.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number">Avoid the financial risks and loss of competitiveness associated with the radical redesign approach.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number">Mitigate the risks that your existing customers will be confused by the new radical design and start spending less.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number">Works at a faster pace and is a more effective form of optimization than a radical redesign.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number">Offers your customers and visitors a website that is continually evolving rather than waiting for the typical 3&#x2013;5-year gaps between radical redesigns.</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="text-fo">However, you may not be in a position to adopt an evolutionary approach to site design, either because of the four reasons listed earlier, or for political reasons management has simply proclaimed &#x2018;We need a better website&#x2019;. It may also be that the business is used to managing projects using the waterfall approach of radical redesign, rather than the modern agile approach.</p>
<p class="text">But what is the impact of the e-commerce website project that goes badly off the rails? To answer this question we commissioned our own research, surveying those with extensive experience of working on these types of project. The study revealed more than half (55 per cent) of respondents experienced problems working on &#x2018;new website and/or functionality&#x2019; projects.</p>
<p class="text">What is clear from our investigation and the M&#x0026;S example was that launching a new e-commerce website often generates significant problems for the business. The investigation showed that the most common problems when launching a new e-commerce website were:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet">Loss of sales/revenue</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Disgruntled visitors</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Management time wasted</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="text-fo">These were not isolated incidents, but experienced by over 70 per cent of our respondents.</p>
<p class="text">It is possible to avoid or mitigate these pitfalls by careful management of a radical redesign project. What follows is a step-by-step guide to protect your online sales when you create a new e-commerce website, and avoid a conversion rate disaster when it&#x2019;s launched.</p>

<h2 id="ch14_h2_001" class="head-a"><span id="page-235" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 235. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>Five stages of a new website</h2>
<p class="text-fo">Our research revealed that the development of an e-commerce website comprises five key stages. Whether you are right at the start and have just got the business case signed off, or whether you are about to go live, there are clear, concrete actions you can take to improve your chances of success after launch.</p>
<aside id="ch14_aside_001" class="box" role="complementary" aria-label="Box (14.1)"><ol class="list-number"><li><p class="list-number">Strategy stage: Development of a business case.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number">Early stage: Production of functional specification and identification of suppliers.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number">Middle stage: Design and development has started.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number">Final stage: The run-up to launch.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number">Live stage: The website has launched.</p></li></ol></aside>
<p class="text-fo">Each stage is different, with a range of beliefs and pitfalls. At any one of these stages, decisions will be taken that could seriously harm sales when the new site is launched.</p>
<p class="text">Conversely, there are concrete actions you can take at each stage, to protect your existing conversion rate and make sure the new site performs as well as or better than the current one. And if you have just launched a new site and the worst has happened, there are methods to revive your sales quickly and effectively.</p>
<section aria-labelledby="ch14_h3_002">
<h3 id="ch14_h3_002" class="head-b">Strategy stage</h3>
<section>
<h4 class="head-c">What happens at the strategy stage?</h4>
<p class="text-fo">Typically, at the strategy stage there is an awareness that the website is becoming out of date, while newer website platforms offer exciting features. Competitors&#x2019; websites are pored over and sometimes copied wholesale (of course, with no knowledge of exactly how well their website is performing).</p>
<p class="text">A financial case may be developed to weigh up the cost of updating and optimizing your current website versus commissioning a new one &#x2013; especially if updates are currently slow and costly to make and/or there are no other companies that could take over the maintenance of the website.</p>
<p class="text"><span id="page-236" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 236. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>Right now though, this analysis is unlikely to be well documented, and the process of deciding whether to replace the current website has just begun.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h4 class="head-c">Beliefs at the strategy stage</h4>
<ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet">While the decision to replace your current website requires a good deal of thought, it is expected that your new website will convert visitors into customers at a much higher rate &#x2013; why else would this much money be spent?</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Expectations are that the new website build, if it happens, will be on time, within budget and deliver substantial ROI.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section>
<h4 class="head-c">Pitfalls at the strategy stage</h4>
<p class="text-fo">Most of the pitfalls at this stage are around the quality of information available and the assumptions that are being made.</p>
<p class="text">It is common at this stage for there to be little investigation into the cheaper (but less exciting) solution of optimizing the current website. This could be a cost-effective way of replacing the current site. In reality, though, once the decision has been made to commission a new website, any expenditure on the current one is often perceived as &#x2018;dead money&#x2019;.</p>
<p class="text">There is a good deal of excitement around the project, and looking forward to the greener grass on the other side that the new website will offer.</p>
<p class="text">Finally, despite all the nightmare stories that surround new website projects going horribly wrong, there is an overwhelming belief that disasters only happen to others.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h4 class="head-c">Conversion rate protection at the strategy stage</h4>
<p class="text-fo">This early stage may be your best opportunity to gain a high-performing &#x2018;new&#x2019; website at a fraction of the cost of replatforming or redesigning, so optimization should be given serious consideration.</p>
<p class="text">What factors should influence your decision? It&#x2019;s all down to how much money is being left on the table versus how much could be gained by launching a new website.</p>
<p class="text">What you know is the cost of the new website and, by extrapolating from previous years&#x2019; revenue, you could forecast likely sales. What you don&#x2019;t know and is hard to predict is the increase you may gain from optimizing <span id="page-237" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 237. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>the current website. What you can do is conduct a review of the website&#x2019;s weaknesses.</p>
<p class="text">As a recap, here are some of the tools and techniques used to do this kind of evaluation:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet"><b>a conversion funnel</b> to reliably show where visitors are dropping off;</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet"><b>heatmaps</b> to understand exactly what your visitors click on, what they don&#x2019;t click on and how they really navigate your pages;</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet"><b>usability testing</b> with testers recruited directly from the website to understand their experience of the current website in the most revealing way;</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet"><b>asking your website visitors and customers</b> why they abandon/don&#x2019;t buy more from your website (either personally, or with a survey);</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet"><b>asking customers</b> why they choose to buy from you and not your competitors;</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet"><b>compiling a list</b> of how you can strengthen your value proposition to your visitors and customers;</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet"><b>benchmarking</b> your website against your competitors&#x2019; websites in terms of the strengths and weaknesses of your value proposition versus theirs.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="text-fo">For more detail on how to research your website and identify conversion killers, reread <a href="09_chapter03.xhtml#ch03_sec_001">Chapters 3</a> to <a href="12_chapter06.xhtml#ch06_sec_001">6</a>.</p>
<p class="text">Having completed this evaluation, you will be far more informed about how the current website can be optimized, without the need to invest in a new website. You can then present a detailed analysis of the costs associated with the new website along with the untapped opportunities still on the current site.</p>

<section>
<h4 class="head-c">What happens at the early stage?</h4>
<p class="text-fo">This is the stage when the business case for a new e-commerce website/platform has been made and the investment has been agreed in principle. The functional specification is being written, web development partners are being appointed and project plans are being finalized.</p>
<p class="text">Although it may seem unthinkable at this point that sales might be lower than at present, it could happen. Here&#x2019;s how you can protect the conversion rate of your website at the early stage.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h4 class="head-c"><span id="page-238" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 238. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>Beliefs at the early stage</h4>
<ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet">It is tacitly expected that the new website will generate positive ROI and convert at a higher rate than the current one.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">It is anticipated that the website will be delivered on time &#x2013; there are months to go before the specified delivery date.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Changes to the functional specification can easily be made. At this stage, it&#x2019;s just a document, with little set in stone.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section>
<h4 class="head-c">Pitfalls at the early stage</h4>
<p class="text-fo">These are some of the practices and assumptions we have seen at first hand that can cause problems later on:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet">Businesses are overly influenced by competitors&#x2019; websites that they believe give their competitors an advantage. However, this can be misleading. The way to stay ahead is to focus on your customers&#x2019; needs, not on what others are doing.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">The functional specification may be based on industry &#x2018;best practice&#x2019; (there are many guides and resources offering this kind of advice). However, these &#x2018;one-size-fits-all&#x2019; techniques may not be right for your website. Websites&#x2019; visitors are unique to the business, and high-converting websites are designed with their needs at the forefront.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Sometimes a functional specification is based on what the business &#x2018;believes&#x2019; about its website visitors and what they want, rather than based on rigorous research. So often these hunches and opinions turn out to be simply wrong &#x2013; or at best do okay, but not as well as a specification based on knowledge of what your real visitors are looking for.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section>
<h4 class="head-c">Conversion rate protection at the early stage</h4>
<p class="text-fo">The key question to focus on at this stage is: &#x2018;How can I be sure that the functional specification for the new website is based on the needs of my website users?&#x2019;</p>
<p class="text">Answering this central question, using similar tools and approaches as deployed in the strategy stage, will help you clearly state what needs to be fixed on your next website.</p>
<p class="text">You can use all of this evidence to create a specification review, which will minimize the risk that the website you are about to commission will fail to <span id="page-239" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 239. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>deliver. This is because you are cross-checking the functional specification with what you now know about your website customers and visitors.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section aria-labelledby="ch14_h3_004">
<h3 id="ch14_h3_004" class="head-b">Middle-stage protection measures</h3>
<section>
<h4 class="head-c">What happens at the middle stage?</h4>
<p class="text-fo">The board has signed off the business case and the project is well under way. The functional specification has been written and approved and now design and development have started.</p>
<p class="text">Wireframes have been developed and may already be signed off, together with the look and feel of the template pages and the user flow through the checkout.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h4 class="head-c">Beliefs at the middle stage</h4>
<ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet">This exciting new e-commerce project is well under way, and is set to deliver a new website jam-packed with features and hooks that it is hoped the visitors are going to love.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">There is excitement to see how different the new website will be from your current one, and the design is much crisper and more modern &#x2013; all the ideas the business had are now crystallized into one perfectly designed website.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">The new website will be launched in time for your peak season and you are sure to capitalize on its extra pulling power, turning visitors into customers at a far higher rate.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section>
<h4 class="head-c">Pitfalls at the middle stage</h4>
<p class="text-fo">Our research shows that these are some of the common issues at this stage:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet">Designers and developers are now running the show and, with a strict deadline, many decisions are being taken without much regard to the users of this new website. Making a website look good is not the same as building one that converts well.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Insufficient thought is being given to the taxonomy of the product categories and subcategories. The assumption is that this hierarchy is easy to change.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Copy for products, categories and general static copy is being left until last &#x2013; just words to fill up the space rather than integral to the customer journey.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="text-fo"><span id="page-240" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 240. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>The project is now clearly in the delivery phase. The time to make large-scale changes has passed, so anything that was not properly thought through in the early stages can&#x2019;t be put right. Any attempt to do so will affect the launch date.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h4 class="head-c">Conversion rate protection in the middle stage</h4>
<p class="text-fo">At this point the central question is &#x2018;How can I be sure that this website is going to deliver, without holding up the go-live date?&#x2019;</p>
<p class="text">In answering this central question, you should consider performing the following quick and easy checks as a mid-launch audit:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet">Get the wireframes and mocked-up pages reviewed by actual users of your website. This is quick and inexpensive, but will give invaluable feedback. True, you may get one or two red warning lights &#x2013; but if they are going to seriously affect conversion rate when the site goes live, it&#x2019;s much easier and cheaper to know now.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Make sure that the copy is professionally written, with the website visitor in mind (not search engine spiders).</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Review the wording around the value proposition of the new website. While the proposition itself should remain constant, there may be a more compelling way of expressing it. Test the new messaging with your customers if you&#x2019;re not sure.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Analyse the sales performance of categories and subcategories to ensure that they are in the correct position within the new navigation.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Perform a look-to-book ratio analysis to see which products require more attention to make them as compelling as others.</p></li>

<h3 id="ch14_h3_005" class="head-b">Final-stage protection measures</h3>
<section><h4 class="head-c">What happens in the final stage?</h4>
<p class="text-fo">The live date is fast approaching</p>
<p class="text">Light years seem to have elapsed since the business case and functional specification were being written. Chances are it&#x2019;s taken longer than everyone expected &#x2013; for a myriad of reasons that are nobody&#x2019;s fault. (We have yet to hear about a new website that launches on time.)</p>
<p class="text">With the live date quickly approaching, relationships may be fraught, tensions running high and team members can&#x2019;t agree on the priorities.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h4 class="head-c"><span id="page-241" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 241. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>Beliefs at the final stage</h4>
<ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet">The website is a few days away from being live and although a number of compromises on all sorts of things have had to be made, it&#x2019;s just a matter of time before you can flick the switch.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Everyone is excited to see how the new website will perform. There is huge expectation that online sales are going to shoot through the roof in the very near future.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section>
<h4 class="head-c">Pitfalls at the final stage</h4>
<p class="text-fo">The main danger at this point is that compromises the business has been forced to make have affected what the website offers to visitors in terms of frictionless usability and a persuasive experience.</p>
<p class="text">Of course, some of those compromises were necessary, as they could have jeopardized the whole project. But some may actually cause the new website to perform at far lower levels of conversion than before.</p>
<p class="text">We have seen this many times over &#x2013; the challenge of keeping to a deadline has meant that some companies have inadvertently thrown out the baby with the bathwater. Even worse, they are really not sure which was the baby and which the bathwater.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h4 class="head-c">Conversion rate protection at the final stage</h4>
<p class="text-fo">At this stage, there&#x2019;s no more time left to make changes for launch day. The main focus now should be to ensure funnels are correctly configured so that the customer journey can be analysed. These funnel reports allow you to make revealing comparisons between the current and new websites.</p>
<p class="text">Useful metrics for benchmarking include:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet">Revenue per visitor (RPV)</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Bounce rate for key landing pages (BR)</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Exit rate (ER)</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Basket abandonment rate (AR)</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Add-to-basket ratios for your bestsellers (A2B)</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Conversion rate (CR)</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="text-fo">Segment these metrics by new and returning visitors, by your five most popular traffic sources and by device type.</p>
<p class="text"><span id="page-242" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 242. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>We very much hope your conversion will not drop when the new site goes live. But we&#x2019;ve seen it happen many times. If you are unlucky enough that it happens to you, you&#x2019;ll be one step ahead, because you&#x2019;ll know exactly where your customers are dropping out compared to the old site.</p>
<p class="text">Also do some usability testing with your website visitors. You won&#x2019;t be able to use their input to make changes to the new site, but it will mean you have a good idea of which elements of the new website are the most important ones to fix as soon as you go live &#x2013; elements that matter to your website visitors, not you.</p>

<section>
<h4 class="head-c">What happens in the live stage?</h4>
<p class="text-fo">If conversion and sales are going up, there is jubilation. But if the numbers are all heading south, it&#x2019;s a real anti-climax. Everyone is disappointed that their months of work have not paid off and morale is low. The finance team may be looking at the money spent and wondering how it was justified for a website that is, seemingly, worse than the one it replaced.</p>
<p class="text">If this has happened, despite all best efforts and smart planning, what can be done?</p>
<p class="text">Sometimes the answer is obvious &#x2013; the funnel tells you that a lot of visitors are dropping out at checkout stage or there is an issue with page load speed.</p>
<p class="text"><span id="page-243" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 243. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>At other times it&#x2019;s not clear. The site loads quickly, looks great and performs functionally, but visitors are just not buying like they used to.</p>

<h4 class="head-c">Beliefs at the live stage</h4>
<p class="text-fo">Plunging sales create an urgent requirement to do something to address the issue &#x2013; and to do it quickly. Everyone is looking for leadership and a sensible course of action that will attack the issue at its core &#x2013; where the problem is and what we are going to do about it. The time for guesswork has passed and everyone is expecting the way forward to be based on data and evidence.</p>

<h4 class="head-c">Pitfalls at the live stage</h4>
<p class="text-fo">As with any crisis, the biggest problem is likely to be the blame game, blind panic and grasping at straws. Every minute needs to be focused on understanding the conversion problem and its root causes.</p>
<p class="text"><span id="page-244" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 244. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>Your analytics reports will tell you where the problems exist between the new and old sites but they won&#x2019;t tell you why these problems exist. By using voice-of-customer tools, like surveys and usability testing with real visitors, you can develop valid hypotheses to test to fix the problems.</p>

<h4 class="head-c">Conversion rate protection at the live stage</h4>
<p class="text-fo">The right approach at this stage is to have a plan &#x2013; and to stick to it. <a id="rch14_fig_003" href="#ch14_fig_003">Figure 14.3</a> shows a step-by-step guide to rescuing a poorly performing new website, sensibly and systematically.</p>

<p class="text-fo">Just like an effective optimization programme, you install tools on your site for research and analysis, as well as split-testing tools to test your hypotheses.</p>
<p class="text">But why put yourself in this situation? Why risk everything, when you can simply optimize the site you&#x2019;ve got, make your customers happy and reap the rewards? We&#x2019;ve shared with you everything you need to put your own programme in place. Follow what we&#x2019;ve told you and it will work. The future is in your hands, and we hope you enjoy the exciting and prosperous journey ahead.</p>

<h2 id="ch14_h2_002" class="head-a">Summary</h2>
<p class="text-fo">Our experience is that in the majority of cases you will gain a greater and quicker return on investment by continuously optimizing your e-commerce website, and going for evolutionary redesign rather than the radical redesign of a brand new website. Of course, there are times when a radical redesign is unavoidable, but it is always worth investigating whether a redesign will bring higher rewards than an evolutionary approach.</p>
<p class="text">There are five stages to launching a new website, and there are pitfalls at each one. You can mitigate the risks by taking protective actions. These actions split into two main approaches.</p>
<p class="text">At the strategy, early and middle stages, focus is on understanding your website visitors and customers and ensuring that their needs will be delivered by the new website.</p>
<p class="text">Later on, at the final and live stages, focus on checking whether there are any negative effects caused by the new website. Research why these pages are causing visitor dropout and then launch split tests to test fixes that will reverse the decline in sales.</p>
<p class="text"><span id="page-245" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label=" Page 245. " epub:type="pagebreak"/>A new website always carries risks, which you can remove entirely by adopting a test and validate approach. Throughout this book, we have aimed to give you the tools to do just that.</p>
<p class="text">We wish you every success.</p>
